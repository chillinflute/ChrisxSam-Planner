	- Localisation for Western Audiences has extended mostly to the language, without cultural translation
- Salaryman Masculinity
	- Male White-collar workers
	- Represents the masculine male ideal in a newly capitalist landscape
	- Office work by day
	- "Corporate soldiers upholding society outside the home"
	- Yakuza mobsters romanticised as upholding traditional values challenging the Westernisation of post-war Japan
- Nightlife and Karaoke
	- Mostly form of social engagement rather than solo performance
	- In Japan, karaoke is taken more seriously as a personal hobby and dedication rather than as a flippant nightlife activity
