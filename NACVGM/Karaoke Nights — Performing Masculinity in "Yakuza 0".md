Yakuza Franchise as an Internation Product

- Yakuza's designer has deliberately chosen a male Japanese audience, to the exclusion of others
	- Localisation for Western Audiences has extended mostly to the language, without cultural translation
- Salaryman Masculinity
	- Male White-collar workers
	- Represents the masculine male ideal in a newly capitalist landscape
	- Office work by day
	- "Corporate soldiers upholding society outside the home"
	- Yakuza mobsters romanticised as upholding traditional values challenging the Westernisation of post-war Japan
- Nightlife and Karaoke
	- Mostly form of social engagement rather than solo performance
	- In Japan, karaoke is taken more seriously as a personal hobby and dedication rather than as a flippant nightlife activity
- Baka Mitai
	- Deepfake creators become widespread in the US in the Autumn of 2020
		- Often showing unrelated characters singing the song "Baka Mitai"
	- This reestablished the popularity of the game 
	- Lyrics for all songs composed by Ryosuke Horii
	- Romanji, but no English translation of lyrics
- Steam and Youtube comments
	- Many list the lyrics along as their review
	- Many express that the music is a substantial part of why they like the game
- Crossing
	- Singing a song presented as being of a gender that is not the performer's
- Meaning of the lyrics
	- Sung by a woman looking back on an ex relationship
	- IN the game, the singer looks at a meaningful photo, but unconnected to the original lyrics
		- The photos are shown to be of significant personal trauma to the singer, but in a masculine context, illustrating social isolation 
		- Without the context of the meaning of the song, many players can recognise that the song is mournful of social isolation, but will fail to understand the social contexts they are interacting with
- "What Kiryu;"
