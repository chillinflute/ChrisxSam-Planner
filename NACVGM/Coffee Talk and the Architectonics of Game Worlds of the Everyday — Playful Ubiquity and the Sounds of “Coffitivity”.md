- Coffee shop, associated with coziness and comfort but also with productivity
	- The idea of regulars, familiar faces and coffee orders
- Depictions of coffee shops all over video games, as well as coffee shop remixes and lofi hip hop/ study beats
- Soundscape studies
	- Sound ecologies are characteristic to and of their environment
		- Bleep speech conversations
		- Constant circulation of lofi chill beats
		- Noises of the coffee equipment
	- "These sounds become a presence, and in that presence become a significant part of the building's infrastructure"
- Uses of coffee shop aesthetics rely on creating a sufficient framework for players/listeners to project their own experience and details of the coffee shops they've experienced onto
- Listening in game sound is action-oriented, rather than solely aesthetic
- Players engage with the lofi music in a way that allows them to engage fully with the narratives of the game
	- In the same way as this genre is used to increase productivity in listeners, in the game's context it is used to allow the player to focus on the narratives being communicated
	- The coffee shop vibes function similarly
- Coffee shops are often really noisy! This is frequently sound-designed out of lots of representations of coffee shops
	- Idealised sonic realism
	- Indie coffee shop vibes versus Starbucks vibes


# Notes

- Used the term bleep speech!
