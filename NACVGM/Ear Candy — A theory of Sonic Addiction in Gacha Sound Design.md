- Mobile games control over 50% of the player base and by far the largest share of the market
- Gacha games are free-to-play games encouraging players to use in-game currency to blindly buy assets in-game in a lottery. Players can naturally buy that currency using real currency.
	- Lootboxes are culturally distinct from gacha, but is heavily inspired by it.
- Gacha pull experience is highly engineered in every respect to heighten sensations of anticipation and reward.
- A semiotics of Gacha Sound
	- Pitch and timbre
	- Dynamics and Gesture
	- Rhythm
- Full of high-pitch, high intensity sound
- Bright sounds above 10kHz abound
- Combine with bright flashing visuals
- Higher frequency sounds prompt significantly higher skin-conductive responses (Dixon et al. 2014)
- Suggests the player always wins
- Special animations and music reserved for the rarest of items and unlocks
	- The music contains more and higher pitched musical cues
- Losses are frequently disguised as wins through these mechanisms
- Interrupting the steady rhythm of pulling is used to celebrate significant reward
	- A technique that is also used in casinos
