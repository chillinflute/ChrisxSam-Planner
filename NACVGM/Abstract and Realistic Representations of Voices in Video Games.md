Fuck this is literally our talk

Realistic vs Abstract representations of voices

- Voice-acted vs Beep speech
	- Beep speech also interpretted as typing?
- In Scholarship
	- Realistic representations of voices vs abstract
- Goal
	- Developing a framework for examining the wide variety of sounds that can represent voices in games
	- Ryan Kane's model (2015) for representation of the voice

Ok it's fine it's not quite the same

- 5 main qualities can represent a voice as relatively realistically
	- Voice-like timbres
	- Multiple phones
		- "phones" = speech sounds
	- Linguistic meaning
	- Translates or duplicates visual text
	- Degree of technological mediation is relaisitc for the given character
	- Phoenix Wright vs Life is Strange as realistic vs abstract on these principles
	- If there is linguistic meaning or translates text, players will expect to understand communication happening in the depiction of the voice
- Kane "The Model of the Voice"
	- Model of voice as a circulation among three main aspects
		- *Logos*
		- *Echos*
		- *Topos*
	- All supplemented by *techne*
- Some more abstract representation of voices can forego *logos*, the other elements are often still relevant
- Players can expect to draw meaning from the logos of the dialogue in *Life is Strange*
- Arcadia The Longest Journey
	- A foreign language is presented in text and the *logos*, and the unfamiliarity of the language is mimicked by the main character as well as the player
	- Familiar words slip into the language as the main character magically begins to translate the language, so the words being spoken are no longer a direct representation of what is being said, but what the main character, and thus the player, is understanding
- Sonic representation of Beedle's voice in Breath of the the wild, is voice acted and communicates some meanings and emotion, but not the full semiotic communication the text would imply
	- Players complete the *echos* and *topos* in their mind in an imagined complete voice
- In the sims there is no visual text, and topic is depicted but semiotic meaning is obscured
- Abstraction is even further when text isn't pertaining to translation of meaning. Celeste uses different sets of sounds with timbres 
- The beeps of Toriel in Undertale 
	- It is voice-like! But doesn't have multiple phones
- Higher pitches sound of female characters speech with males lower, and slower or faster beeps indicate speeches
- *Pyre* (2017)
	- Certain voices in particular places is just indicative of speech in general
	- "The Voice" is depicted fairly literally
		- Spoken English dialogue is used to indicate an ancient form of language that few of the in-game characters understand
	- Volfred momentarily speaks fully voice acted in English, before returning to his usual speech indications
		- Signifying speaking directly into the mind of a character
		- Indication of something magical
	- Some words directly translate from the in-game language to english
		- "Nightwings" as "Noxalis"
		- Examined across Steam Pages

# Things we need to talk to her about

- Use of her 5 main qualities chart to taxonomise our case studies before examining that abstractions role in the context of the game
- Establishing the differences between our talks
	- Hers is more a taxonomy and examination of the means and method of abstraction
		- She delves into how the use of abstraction can be used to communicate narrative
	- Ours is more focussed specifically on characterisation
		- Her example of Volfred might well be key, definitely need to add *Pyre* to the case study list
