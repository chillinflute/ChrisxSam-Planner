## Ingredients 

- 4 [large organic egg whites,](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/egg-glossary) at room temperature
- 115g [caster sugar](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/sugar-glossary)
- 115g [icing sugar](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/sugar-glossary)
- 1 teaspoon of vinegar

## Method
- Heat the oven to 110C/ 100C fan/gas ¼.

- Line 2 [baking sheets](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/kimberley-wilsons-top-5-baking-trays) with non-stick liner or [parchment paper](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/baking-equipment) (meringue can stick on greaseproof paper and foil).

- Tip **4 large egg whites** into a large clean [mixing bowl](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/top-five-mixing-bowls) (not plastic). Beat them on medium speed with an [electric hand whisk](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/best-whisks) until the mixture resembles a fluffy cloud and stands up in stiff peaks when the blades are lifted.

- Now turn the speed up and start to add **115g caster sugar**, **a dessertspoonful at a time**. Continue beating for 3-4 seconds between each addition. It’s important to add the sugar slowly at this stage as it helps prevent the meringue from weeping later. However, don’t over-beat. When ready, the mixture should be thick and glossy.

 - [Sift](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/best-flour-sifters) **one third of the 115g icing sugar** over the mixture, then gently fold it in with a big metal spoon or rubber [spatula](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/best-spatulas). Continue to sift and fold in the **remaining icing sugar a third at a time**. Again, don’t over-mix. The mixture should now look smooth and billowy.

- Scoop up a heaped dessertspoonful of the mixture. Using another dessertspoon, ease it on to the baking sheet to make an oval shape. Or just drop them in rough rounds, if you prefer.

- Bake for 1 ½-1 ¾ hours in a fan oven, 1 ¼ hours in a conventional or gas oven, until the meringues sound crisp when tapped underneath and are a pale coffee colour.

- Leave to cool on the trays or a [cooling rack](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/baking-equipment). _(The meringues will now keep in an airtight tin for up to 2 weeks, or frozen for a month.)_ Serve two meringues sandwiched together with a generous dollop of softly whipped double cream.
