## Ingredients

-   6 firm but ripe mangoes (about 1.5kg)
-   500ml white wine vinegar
-   450g [granulated sugar](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/sugar-glossary)
-   1 tbsp [cumin seeds](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/cumin-glossary)
-   2 tsp [coriander seeds](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/coriander-seed-glossary)
-   10 cardamom pods
-   2 tsp [nigella seeds](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/nigella-seed-glossary)
-   ½ tsp cayenne pepper
-   ½ tsp [turmeric](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/turmeric-glossary)
-   3 [garlic cloves](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/garlic-glossary), crushed
-   8 [whole cloves](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/clove-glossary)
-   thumb-sized piece of [ginger](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/ginger-glossary), grated
-   1 [fat red chilli](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/chilli-glossary), seeds removed and finely chopped

### Method

-   STEP 1
    
    Peel the mangoes and chop the flesh into blueberry-sized pieces. Pour the vinegar and sugar into a large [pan](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/five-best-saucepans) and simmer gently, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat and bubble for 8-10 mins until reduced a little. Meanwhile, toast the cumin, coriander and cardamom in a dry pan until aromatic.
    
-   STEP 2
    
    Tip the spices into a [pestle and mortar](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/top-five-mortar-and-pestles)and gently crush them, leaving the seeds with some texture. Remove the cardamom pods, leaving the seeds in the spice mix, and add to the vinegar mix along with the mangoes, the other ingredients and 2 tsp salt. Bubble over a medium heat for 1 hr 15 mins – 1 hr 35 mins, until thick and syrupy. Leave to sit for 10 mins.
    
-   STEP 3
    
    Transfer the chutney into 2-3 sterilised jars while still hot. Seal the jars and leave to cool, then add labels. Store in a cool place for up to 2 years – the chutney will be best eaten after a few months, when the flavours have melded and mellowed.

### How long does mango chutney last?

The vinegar and sugar in mango chutney act as preservatives for the fruit. Covered in the fridge but not jarred, your chutney will last a good few weeks. It might seem obvious, but as tempting as it is to double-dip when serving chutney as part of a curry spread, be careful to always use a clean spoon so as not to introduce anything that might encourage mould.

If you want to make a large batch of chutney, you have a few different options to preserve it. If you sterilise Kilner or jam jars and fill them with your chutney, the chutney will keep for up to two years unopened in a dark, cool place. Once opened, keep chilled and use within two months.

### Can I freeze mango chutney?

For an even easier method, you can freeze mango chutney in small freezer bags or food containers. While some advocate for using ice cube trays, small weaning pots designed for baby purées can be a good investment for condiments and sauces that you use in small quantities. This method dispenses with any need to sterilise jars, too. When ready to eat, just transfer a portion to the fridge and defrost overnight.

### Can you use canned or frozen mango instead of fresh?

Canned mango is suitable for making chutney. Drain all the syrup away and taste the final chutney, as it may require more acidity to balance the extra sugar from the syrup. You may not have to cook the mango for as long as fresh fruit either, as canned mango tends to be already part-cooked and fairly soft.

If using chunks of frozen mango, defrost first to remove excess ice and drain this off before making your chutney.

### How to serve mango chutney

Mango chutney is the perfect condiment for a spicy or creamy curry, often alongside natural yogurt. Try serving it alongside Roopa Ghulati’s [homestyle chicken curry](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/home-style-chicken-curry) or our [lamb vindaloo](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/lamb-vindaloo); or, for a milder curry, our South Indian [fried fish & tomato curry](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/fried-fish-tomato-curry)should hit the spot.

The sweetness of mango chutney works wonders with salty cheese as in these [campfire toasties](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/mango-chutney-campfire-cheese-toasties). Or, you could try using naan as we've done with our [mango chutney & cheese naan toastie](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/mango-chutney-cheese-naan-toastie).

The sticky-sweet texture and flavour of mango chutney works very well as a glaze in these [mango & lime chicken wings](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/mango-lime-chicken-wings) and [baked feta with lentils](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/mango-chutney-baked-feta-lentils).
