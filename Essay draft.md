It is only natural that musicologists attempt to establish distinctions between different styles of music. When certain pieces of music evoke different reactions in us and attract different audiences to them, it can be tempting to approach the evaluation of **why** by breaking down the musical features that contribute to that effect. An interesting distinction in other music that has similarly progressed through jazz is the critical attitudes towards "light" and "serious" music. Examining the ways in which different styles of jazz developed through "light"/"popular", and "serious" will play an important part in distinguishing which the role each style played in society at the time, as well as showing the musicologistical history of nuanced genre classification. %% you could try looking for [this paper](https://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/conferences/simcat/clark.htm), for instance, for a general attempt at theory of categorisation, Amira's paper also has some good citations very much on this topic for you to nick %%
Scholars have certainly attempted the same of jazz; given that throughout its growing popularity in the twentieth century there was such a range in the musicians' backgrounds, cultural settings, and overall attitude to jazz from the general public, the complexities of its progression and retrospective "eras" have led to the attempt to categorise it into broader styles, all under the umbrella of "jazz". Though in recent years this has involved some evaluation of socio-geographic context, this has predominantly been carried out through positivist analysis. 
This essay will attempt to carry out a positivist analysis of two case studies of different "jazz styles", as well as discussing the flaws to this approach and other methods of gaining additional perspectives. Furthermore, there will be a discussion of the limitations in trying to categorise music, especially such that is so thoroughly and complexly hybridised.

What is commonly referred to as "hard bop" emerged in the mid-1950s ([[@rosenthalHardBopBegins1994|Rosenthal, 1994]]). It is said to have been a response to bebop, with its musicians wanting to reinstate some of jazz's African-American roots that they felt had been lost in contemporary performance [citation]. Thus, we can see some of the same features in hard bop, as those in both blues, and gospel styles. 

"To Whom It May Concern" is one of eight tracks on the album *Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers* [citation]. Comprising mostly Silver's own compositions ([[@silver2007let|Silver, 2007]]), the album is considered one of the primary influences on the hard bop movement away from bebop. Silver especially credits a lot of his compositional output to his upbringing and the music he loved as a child, which are again consistent with the aforementioned styles ([[@silver2007let|ibid, 2007]]).

"To Whom It May Concern" consists of alternating sections that contrast quite profoundly with each other. The head itself follows an AABA structure, before moving to a new progression (C) for the various solos. In the head, the A section explores an unusually dark, minor sound, emphasised with diminished and half diminished sevenths ([citation, help me]), before moving to a distinctive rhumba groove for the B section. The descending chromatic chordal motion is also incredibly characterful; though not a rare progression, it's repetition and sequential movement over the 12 bars create a unique feel.

==The influences on the A section are not entirely clear — some reviews refer to "flamenco rhythms" ([[@altrockchickHoraceSilverHorace2017|"altrockchick", 2017]]), a link which is tenuous at best, but the deviation of this section in its harmonic, rhythmic and shape from what was consider "typical" of jazz, and particularly bebop, at this time massively elucidates the idea of hybridising that Silver wanted to incorporate into his work.== %% move this sentence somewhere else? %%

Notably, some of the change in feel between the sections comes from the drumkit; the A section melody has a rather sparse kit part, mostly following the rhythm of the frontline on the snare drum, as well as the fill connecting the two consecutive A sections only being ==on the floor tom==. The A section also has a call and response feel, the 12-bar form following a fairly strict pattern of 1-bar tutti %% not a good jazz word ik %%, then 1-bar unison in the frontline.
In the B section, the familiar rhumba rhythm (see Figure 1) in the piano grounds the ==style==, Art Blakey then emphasising this with the cymbals in the build-up to the end of the section.

After the head finishes, the improvised solos commence. Horace Silver takes the first solo on piano, exhibiting many of the blues features and drawing from very little, supposed, bebop improvisatory style.

Whilst jazz fusion had already been fairly well-established by the 1980s — with Weather Report and Miles Davis having released albums pioneering the style a decade earlier ([[@madsen2021significant|Madsen, 2021]]) — fusion, by nature, offered a greater level of exploration and experimentation than any form of jazz that came before: hybridising multiple genres leaves more elements at the disposal of the performer, meaning that such an umbrella term as "jazz fusion" opens the door to some vastly differing results.

"Straphangin'" is the first track of the eponymous album released in 1981 by The Brecker Brothers [citation]. Both Michael and Randy Brecker had backgrounds in rock and jazz, thus leading to this track combining elements of both, as well as incorporating perceived trademarks of other styles. The level of pre-determined composition involved on the track is fairly high, the piece being an original written by Michael Brecker and bearing some structural similarities to Silver's 'To Whom It May Concern' through its use of internal contrast. The instrumental line-ups are also fairly similar; a front line of trumpet and tenor sax, then a rhythm section accompanying this (though on "Straphangin'", the pianist plays a synth keyboard on an electric piano sound). On paper, the influences, method, and timbres of these pieces may seem comparable, but the overall effects as they are experienced by an audience differ greatly.

Form-wise, "Straphangin'" resembles a jazz standard in its core structure. Roughly following an intro-head-solos-head-outro format, it holds the common form of many standards as they are performed today. The track opens with a grand, diatonic, fanfare motive, a stark juxtaposition to Silver's dark harmonies and chromatic movement. This section bears little similarity to jazz, rock, or funk, instead having the feel of a march through its lack of syncopation, straight metric feel, slow tempo, yet driving drum part consisting of snare rolls, and other military percussion techniques and patterns.
This transitions into a laid-back funk groove, through a held tension chord (==V7#5==). The drum pattern and the frequent use of cymbals brings in the rock undertones of the fusion, though with a shuffle feel. The use of harmony in this section is quite adventurous, with the exploration of augmented chords, brief modulations from ==D to F#==, and daring upper extensions. Despite some of the bolder experimental choices in this section, it remains accessible to the unfamiliar ear through use of catchy blues licks, such as in [Figure whatever]. ==Only perhaps in overall effect does Straphangin's main head share many similarities with 'To Whom It May Concern' — whilst many measurable features of both, such as harmony and approach to style, do not have much in common, the simple catchiness of both melodies — in part due to blues influence — feels core to the way they are experienced by their audience.== %% fuck does this need splitting up into smaller sentences %%

[side-by-side comparison of melodies to show bluesiness]

For the solos, a riff is used to transition into the chord progression, and also to bridge between the solos. The chord progression at this point entirely follows jazz norms, filled with familiar cycle of fifths movement and ==ii-V-I== patterns. Michael takes three choruses to improvise over. He opens the solo with long, syncopated guide tones, a soulful depth to his tone colour, and seamless direction moving from chord to chord. This opening chorus is relaxed in tone, mostly serving melodic function but also introducing some of the motives used throughout the solo, for example the descending G altered scale (interspersed with some chromatic movement) over G7#9 in bar 14 of the solo. The second chorus starts to explore more technical approaches, hitting the extremes of the saxophone register within the space of a couple bars

Krin Gabbard's work on the jazz canon feels especially relevant to the conversation of epitomising jazz 'genre'; genres/styles were applied retrospectively to jazz by historiographers, and can only have been compiled by utilising the broad strokes of the canon, thus intrinsically linking these conversations. Looking at Gabbard, his article *The Jazz Canon and Its Consequences* ([[@gabbard1995jazz|1995]]) discusses the necessary intersection of jazz and critical analysis, critising the formalist approach of "canonising based in an aesthetic of unity and coherence" ([[@gabbard1995jazz|Ibid., pg. 12]]). This discussion has long been held in relation to the broader Western art music canon, Kerman having instigated similar critiques against his musicologist contemporaries ([[@doi_10.1086_448101|1980]]). It becomes difficult to argue that the same should not be true of jazz. As Gabbard points out, value should not be placed on an artwork based on how well it exhibits the thematic structures expected of its style — leading us back to the way in which we evaluate jazz. Taking an entirely posivist approach to analysis validates inherently flawed formalist ideas, therefore utilising another approach to considering these pieces in conjunction with that approach is better at encompassing factors such as the backgrounds of the musicians involved, the performance/recording venue, and social function of jazz more generally. 

With this in mind, this may recontextualise the analysis already conducted. Looking back at "To Whom It May Concern", Horace Silver, the composer of the tune, spoke openly about his formative years growing up in poverty in Norwalk (a city in Connecticut, very near New York City), as well as his first thoughts on and encounters with music ([[@silver2007let|Silver, 2007]]). Initially, he only began learning piano by coincidence, but grew to love it after seeing the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra ([[@silver2007let|ibid., pg. 13]]). This gives us some idea of the musical influences he was exposed to as a child; in this same autobiography, he mentions his father's Cape Verdean heritage and how Cape Verdean folk music would be played at celebrations in his childhood home, as well as his neighbour who was a ragtime pianist. The A section does not appear to have any one prevailing cultural influence on it, but rather a hybrid based on Silver's musical preferences — an admittedly fleeting look at Cape Verdean musical tradition does not shed huge light on any intended "style" for this section, neither flamenco ([[@CaboVerde|Hurley-Glowa, 2020]]; [[@Flamenco|Katz, 2001]]). A perhaps passing family resemblance () between this section and flamenco may be loosely perceived in the hemiola effect caused by the quaver triplet in bar 1, contrasted by straight quavers in the following bar

%%I'd detach yourself slightly more from this, especially since you're critiquing this form of analysis!%%

jazz fusion as a style is difficult to define concretely with musical features; it's more conceptual and practice-based than that, and encapsulates so many different, already-broad styles within it that to call any particular style emblematic would be inaccurate

represented not through necessary and sufficient conditions of musical features 

the paradigm case: a case which unambiguously falls under the common definition of the term, and so can be taken as a definite instance of the supposedly non-existent concept. tendency to exclude the "best examples" of each style, and to exclude people that weren't popular
%%

The changing perspectives on jazz recordings is really exemplified in comparison of these two recordings: though "To Whom It May Concern" is an original composition and arrangement by Silver, "Straphangin'" altogether feels more meticulous and 'to the note' %% better term for this? %%. For example, on "To Whom It May Concern" it can even be heard that the trumpet player, Kenny Dorham, forgets to come in for the final B section at roughly 4:27. It is not necessarily that we should make value judgements about jazz on this basis (although some might argue the same would not be true for other styles), but it speaks to a more human, less polished aspect to jazz recordings prior to advanced recording technology made available by the digital audio workstation (DAW). 



There are shortcomings to every approach to analysis, but detailed musical analysis, i.e., the recognition and description of expected musical notions, individual to a particular style, often only recognisable with the use of a written score, seems a problematic fit for jazz of all styles.
