# Things to Work on Independently
## Within
- Everyone
	- Any rhythmically challenging bits e.g. b52-69
	- Quick notes(?) e.g. b83
- Flute 1
	- Tune at the beginning — lots of low note (and B if you've got it)
	- Try beginning to work out the alt fingerings for the tune at the beginning
- Flute 2
	- Syllables down the flute b26
- Flute 5 
	- Begin working on passage at b. 30, start at half tempo
	- Flourishes at b58 — more of a gesture than exact notes
- Low flutes
	- Start to get the percussive breathy sound at b32 (bass)
	- Solos at b71 and b76
## Single Yellow Line
- Everyone 
	- Secure rhythms throughout
	- Dynamics throughout, but especially any of the *subito* changes (beginning especially)
	- Accents whenever you have the tune, or in rhythmic parts going across beats
	- Legato *dolce* at b. 17 and running into it
	- Playing off the beat at L: don't creep back onto the beat! Maybe try practicing with metronome
- Flute 1
	- Passage at M — keeping evenness, consistent tuning, etc.
- Flutes 1-3, Alto
	- Stay rhythmic + no dragging in low register
- Low flutes
	- Projection and attack throughout, especially when with tune
## Jigs
- Everyone 
	- Adding in any of the unfamiliar ornamentation (practice altogether slowly)
	- Double-tonguing sections (Zyncathos)
	- Time signature changes in the chorale (Road to Swallowtail) b55 
- Alto
	- Bits of melody throughout, play out confidently e.g. F (Road to Swallowtail), opening bars (Dusty Windowsills)
- Bass
	- Opening solo to The Road to The Swallowtail

Please take initiative on picking other sections you need to practice!
