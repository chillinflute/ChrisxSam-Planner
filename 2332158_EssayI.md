**Taking a popular musical theatre work premiered between 1927 and 1965 of your choice (excluding _Show Boat_, _Oklahoma!,_ _Kiss Me Kate_ and _West Side Story_), discuss how the use of any pre-existing source (novel, play etc), and the work's sociocultural context (e.g. the time and situation of the first production) affected: the dramatic/narrative themes; the purpose, structure and tone (i.e. 'audience messaging' on subjects such as social and cultural values and morals); and musical organisation.  (The emphases placed on the various elements listed here will depend on the show chosen.)** 


*The King and I* is a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that premiered on Broadway in 1951. Though it has seen several revivals and remained popular to this day, it has also been met with some criticism in recent years due to its portrayal of East Asian characters; a similar criticism having been levelled at numerous other musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein such as *South Pacific* (1949) and *Flower Drum Song* (1958), [@mcconachie1994oriental](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@mcconachie1994oriental.md). Whilst there is a limit on how much it is reasonable to judge these works based on a greatly changed (and constantly changing) moral standard, it is still fair to say the racial insensitivities presented by *The King and I* were also specifically a product of attitudes in the US at its time of premiere. 
Many of the themes presented in *The King and I* tie in closely with the setting of Siam — power dynamics in the royal court, belittling of non-Western culture — yet many also pose more universal concepts, such as love (in its various circumstances), equality, and anti-slavery sentiments.
Despite all appearances: *The King and I* is not about Siam. I hypothesise that the reason the setting of Siam is handled with little respect to authenticity or sensitivity to a very real culture it plays on is, rather obviously, to appease audiences. Rodgers and Hammerstein were concerned above all else with the reception of their musicals, and it was this priority that superseded all creative decisions in their portrayal of Siam. This, as I will explore throughout, is what led to dialogue, plot, and staging choices that, today, we would consider unacceptable.
The true subtext of *The King and I* centres around the imposition of Western ideas upon the East. The overall impression of its main theme from an audience perspective might be of love, as the musical covers multiple different couples and their differing situations, but a look deeper reflects so much of what were evident truths about the US in the 1950s.


One factor that will help to ascertain the perspective of Hammerstein in particular (as the book writer for *The King and I* %%reference?%%) whilst he was on the project is his source material, and potential faithfulness to it originally. The plot outline actually follows a "true" story, Anna Leonowens' life in the mid-1800s. The musical itself is a tertiary source: based on Landon's novel *Anna and the King of Siam* [@landonAnnaKingSiam1944](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@landonAnnaKingSiam1944.md) which was itself based on Leonowens' own memoirs. As the second derivative, it would not be unfair to assume that information would be lost for a number of reasons — most prominently in these semi-fictionalised works, for the sake of entertainment value to the reader/audience{>>Is this the only factor at play? Could changes to the material not also be due to latent contemporary prejudices?<<}; we certainly see this between Landon's novel and Hammerstein's changes to the plot and some characters' portrayals in particular. %%-> does this need building on some more?%%
The difference between Landon's King of Siam and Hammerstein's is quite drastic in some respects: in *The King and I*, we become accustomed to his simple way of speaking, an indication of his struggling with the English language, whereas Landon writes him as eloquently competent at English{>>A bit wordy, there's surely a more concise way of writing this<<}. His character is presented more intelligently in this way, throwing out complex sentence constructions such as "You shall copy on round hand for my readily perusal thereof" %%reference?%%, whereas Hammerstein writes his dialogue in broken, improper English, such as "Please to recite proverb you have learned yesterday and writing down twelve times in your copybook", often missing out both definite and indefinite articles %% reference script? %%. The intention behind this was to exaggerate further the portrayal of the King as unintelligent and primitive, in keeping with the ideas of Western superiority.

Overall, it seems to be agreed today that Anna Leonowens, in her original memoirs, was not a reliable narrator [@doi:10.1080/23306343.2015.1060922](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@doi_10.1080_23306343.2015.1060922.md). A cursory glance over her book [@leonowens1873english](@leonowens1873english.md) is enough to spot her closed-mindedness to any non-Western tradition; indeed, from the moment she meets the Siamese prime minister, she questions his sense of authority "at variance" with his state of dress (pg. 9){>>You might need to clarify what is happening in this scene as the reader doesn't know how he is dressed<<}. Landon only built on this tone, though to fit the semi-fictionalised, novel medium, setting up her book with several chapters establishing our sympathies as readers with the protagonist, Anna; leading us only further to trusting her later in the book, even when she makes comments to herself about kowtowing subjects such as "At least I am not a worm like those poor reptiles on the floor!" [-@landonAnnaKingSiam1944, pg. 58](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@landonAnnaKingSiam1944.md){>>Again you need to explain that this is referring to kowtowing subjects<<}. We see the way this affects the tone of *The King and I*, with Anna echoing the same sentiments on these traditions, particularly in 'Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?'. 

While Anna is an outcast according to the plot, she is never portrayed as such; the audience's sympathies fully lie with her, thus it is never her that is played for laughs. An outsider to Siamese culture, %% this needs to go somewhere else %%

The political climate in which *The King and I* was contrived by Hammerstein was exceedingly complex; following World War II, the US government became alarmed by the growing power and influence of the USSR — and alongside this, most critically, the rise of communism [@schlesingerOriginsColdWar1967](@schlesingerOriginsColdWar1967.md). McCarthyism was rampant in the US during the '50s, cultivating great fear among the general public, and a massive ideological division between the US and much of Asia [@patterson1996grand](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@patterson1996grand.md). 
A look at the US's foreign policy statement on Thailand in 1950 is reminiscent of many of the internationally political undertones in *The King and I* [@petersenPolicyStatementPrepared1950]: that Thailand must modernise, become economically stronger, and have a greater internal political stability, or risk the threat communist forces. The parallels with Anna's arrival to Siam are noticeably similar, but with the goal being to protect the nation from British colonisation.
These ideas are heavily built on an infantilisation of East Asia in the Western world. This was in part due to the concept that McConachie dubs 'containment' [-@mcconachie1994oriental](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@mcconachie1994oriental.md): that lesser-developed countries are more inward-looking, and thus are viewed as inferior by more developed countries for this reason alone. From the highly globalised US perspective, this created somewhat of a saviour complex; that Thailand was a primitive nation, blissfully unaware of the external threats of communism, in need of Western technologies and social policies to safeguard themselves. The way this is reflected in *The King and I* is not subtle — Anna is quick to judge perceived Siamese shortcomings such as the harem of the King and enforce her ideas of monogamy and feminism in order to "improve" the culture of the nation.
The problem therein does not lie with this pointing out of harmful traditional practices, but the way Anna exercises this perceived moral high-ground to criticise any and all traditions that differ from Western ones, for example kowtowing, which is played up massively beyond realistic practices in the musical [@jory2015thailand](@jory2015thailand.md), for example in Act I: Scene I.

This infantilisation of other cultures also leads to the depictions of the Siamese as less capable and intelligent in general. In particular, the King's wives exhibit these traits and come to admire and rely heavily on Anna for their education (as grown adults). 
%% need some examples to prove how this is played up %%


Many of Rodgers' musical decisions were grounded in Western accessibility and so as not to alienate the typical Broadway audience; the choice, for example, to portray the Siamese language with sounds from the orchestra as opposed to any kind of spoken language, genuine Thai or not, exemplifies that. Rodgers faced a unique challenge of trying to balance creating an oriental, foreign soundworld to the ears of the US, whilst not estranging this audience through entirely unfamiliar East Asian gestures. However, this meant he did not need to preserve any level of linguistic or musical authenticity, as his top priority was to present Siam as 'other.'
The musical's ballet 'The Small House of Uncle Thomas' is a scene that most encapsulates this idea, though examining the thought and intention behind it can become convoluted due its layers of diegeticism.

It is the more universal themes such as love that give Rodgers' and Hammerstein's musicals their timeless quality. The setting of *The King and I* could be any country other than a Western one in order to portray the superiority complex of our Western protagonist and the plot could remain the same.
While the musical remains a product of its time in several ways, with many of these resultant cultural manifestations deeply embedded into its construction (in all aspects of a musical's stimuli, but in particular the musical score), it's charming appeal ultimately comes from its engaging characters and humanisation of its themes. Love is presented in all kinds of complex varieties: forbidden,
