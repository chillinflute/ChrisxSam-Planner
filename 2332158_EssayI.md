**Taking a popular musical theatre work premiered between 1927 and 1965 of your choice (excluding _Show Boat_, _Oklahoma!,_ _Kiss Me Kate_ and _West Side Story_), discuss how the use of any pre-existing source (novel, play etc), and the work's sociocultural context (e.g. the time and situation of the first production) affected: the dramatic/narrative themes; the purpose, structure and tone (i.e. 'audience messaging' on subjects such as social and cultural values and morals); and musical organisation.  (The emphases placed on the various elements listed here will depend on the show chosen.)** 


Rodgers and Hammerstein's *The King and I* (*TK&I*) premiered on Broadway in 1951. Though it has seen several revivals and remains popular to this day, it has also been met with some criticism in recent years due to its portrayal of East Asian characters and culture; a similar criticism having been levelled at numerous other musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein. Notably, McConachie [-@mcconachie1994oriental](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@mcconachie1994oriental.md) has criticised *South Pacific* (1949) and *Flower Drum Song* (1958), alongside *TK&I*, for depicting a homogenous 'other' out of three distinctly separate cultures. Whilst there is a limit on how much it is reasonable to judge these works based on a greatly changed (and constantly changing) moral standard [@bloomHowMoralsChange2010](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@bloomHowMoralsChange2010.md), it is still fair to say that the racial insensitivities presented by *TK&I* were also specifically a product of contemporaneous attitudes in the US.
Many of the themes presented in *TK&I* are intrinsic to the setting of Siam — power dynamics in the royal court, East versus Western culture — yet many also pose more universal concepts, such as love (in its various circumstances), equality, and anti-slavery sentiments.
Crucially, despite all appearances: *TK&I* is not about Siam. I hypothesise that the reason the setting of Siam was handled with little concern to authenticity or sensitivity to a very real culture, was simply to appease audiences. Rodgers and Hammerstein were concerned above all else with the reception of their musicals, and it was this priority that superseded all creative decisions in their portrayal of Siam. This, as I will explore throughout, is what led to dialogue, plot, and staging choices that, today, would be considered unacceptable. The true subtext of *TK&I* centres around the imposition of Western ideas upon the East. The audience's thematic reception might be of love, as the musical covers multiple couples and their differing situations, but a closer reading reflects the emerging *zeitgeist* of Occident-Oriental cultural tensions.


One factor that helps to ascertain the perspective of Hammerstein in particular [^1] is found within his source material, and level of faithfulness thereto. The plot outline follows a "true" story, Anna Leonowens' life in the mid-1800s. The musical itself is a tertiary source: based on Landon's novel *Anna and the King of Siam* [-@landonAnnaKingSiam1944](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@landonAnnaKingSiam1944.md), which was itself based on Leonowens' own memoirs. As the second derivative, narratively-speaking, it would be logical to assume that information would be lost for a number of reasons — audience appeasement, subconscious biases, adaptation of events to fit desired narrative frameworks — due to the semi-fictionalised style of these works. This can certainly be observed between Landon's novel and Hammerstein's changes to the plot and some characters' portrayals in particular.
The difference between Landon's and Hammerstein's depictions of the King of Siam is quite drastic in some respects: in *TK&I*, we become accustomed to his simple way of speaking, an indication of his struggling with the English language, whereas Landon writes him as eloquent in English. His character is presented more intelligently in this way, throwing out complex sentence constructions such as "You shall copy on round hand for my readily perusal thereof" %% reference page number %%, whereas Hammerstein writes his dialogue in broken, ungrammatical English, such as "Please to recite proverb you have learned yesterday and writing down twelve times in your copybook", often missing out both definite and indefinite articles [@hammersteinKingCompleteBook2016](@hammersteinKingCompleteBook2016.md). The effect is to exaggerate further the portrayal of the King as unintelligent and primitive, in keeping with the ideas of Western superiority, as discussed hereon.

Overall, it seems agreed upon today that Anna Leonowens, in her original memoirs, was not a reliable narrator [@doi:10.1080/23306343.2015.1060922](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@doi_10.1080_23306343.2015.1060922.md). A cursory glance over her book [-@leonowens1873english](@leonowens1873english.md) is enough to spot her closed-mindedness to any non-Western tradition; indeed, from the moment she meets the Siamese prime minister, she questions his sense of authority "at variance" with his state of dress (pg. 9)[^2]. Landon only built on this tone. Through the semi-fictionalised, novel medium, she establishes the reader's sympathies with the protagonist, Anna; preceding her interactions with the Siamese with several chapters of sympathetic exposition of her character. In this way  the reader comes to trust her perspective later in the book, even when her internal monologuing demeans the Siamese, referring to kowtowing subjects as "those poor reptiles on the floor!" [-@landonAnnaKingSiam1944, pg. 58](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@landonAnnaKingSiam1944.md). It can be seen the way in which this affects the tone throughout *TK&I*, with Anna echoing the same sentiments in regard to these traditions, particularly in 'Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?' where she angrily ridicules Siamese traditions[^3]. This also influences the audience's perception of these traditions, in part due to the physical comedy enacted in their portrayal by exaggerating movements like kowtowing and leaving awkwardly long pauses for Anna (and thus the audience) to judge these characters (again, e.g. Act I Scene I), as she does in Landon's book. 
While Anna is an outcast in the plot, she is never portrayed as such dramatically; the audience is endeared to her judgement, thus it is never her that is played for laughs on a cultural basis. There is never an 'otherness' to her actions — the only times she is the direct subject of comic relief is on an emotional footing, such as her mispronunciations in 'Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?' to convey her anger. The song's rhythmic, spoken quality harkens to elements of Gilbert and Sullivan patter, following a comedic style — but it is her over-emotionality in contrast to her otherwise level-headed demeanour that is amusing[^5].

The political climate in which *TK&I* was contrived by Hammerstein was exceedingly complex; following World War II, the US government became alarmed by the growing power and influence of the USSR — and alongside this, most critically, the rise of communism [@schlesingerOriginsColdWar1967](@schlesingerOriginsColdWar1967.md). McCarthyism was rampant in the US during the '50s, cultivating great anti-communist paranoia among the general public, and a massive ideological division between the US and much of Asia [@patterson1996grand](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@patterson1996grand.md). 
A look at the US's foreign policy statement on Thailand in 1950 is reminiscent of many of the internationally political undertones in *TK&I* [@petersenPolicyStatementPrepared1950]: that Thailand must modernise, become economically stronger, and have a greater internal political stability, or risk succumbing to the "threat" of communist forces. The parallels with Anna's arrival to Siam are noticeably similar, but with the goal being to protect the nation from British colonisation. Intentional or not in Hammerstein's writing, British colonisation being a metaphor for invasive communism (especially considering the US's history with Britain) is implicit.
These ideas are heavily built on an infantilisation of East Asia in the Western world. This was in part due to the concept that McConachie dubs 'containment' [-@mcconachie1994oriental](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@mcconachie1994oriental.md): that lesser-developed countries are more inward-looking and oblivious to the larger world, and thus are viewed as inferior by more developed countries. From the highly globalised US perspective, this created somewhat of a saviour complex; that Thailand was a primitive nation, blissfully unaware of the external threats of communism, in need of Western technologies and social policies to safeguard themselves. The way this is reflected in *TK&I* is not subtle — Anna is quick to judge perceived Siamese shortcomings such as the harem of the King and enforce her ideas of monogamy and feminism in order to "improve" the culture of the nation. 
The problem therein does not lie with this pointing out of harmful traditional practices, but the way Anna exercises this perceived moral high-ground to criticise any and all traditions that differ from Western ones, for example kowtowing, which is played up massively beyond realistic practices in the musical [@jory2015thailand](@jory2015thailand.md), for example in Act I: Scene I.
This attitude of infantilisation of Siam is perfectly encapsulated by Anna's line to her young son in Act II: Scene 8, "In some ways he was just as young as you" [@hammersteinKingCompleteBook2016](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@hammersteinKingCompleteBook2016.md).

Many of Rodgers' musical decisions were grounded in Western accessibility and so as not to alienate the typical Broadway audience; the choice, for example, to portray the Siamese language with ornamental pentatonic gestures (see Figure 1) from the orchestra as opposed to any kind of spoken language, genuine Thai or not, exemplifies that [@hammersteinKingCompleteBook2016](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@hammersteinKingCompleteBook2016.md). Rodgers faced a unique challenge of trying to balance creating an oriental, foreign soundworld to the ears of the US, whilst not estranging this audience through entirely unfamiliar East Asian gestures. However, this meant he did not need to preserve any level of linguistic or musical authenticity, as his top priority was to present Siam as 'other.'

To emphasise this juxtaposition, Anna's songs predominantly take on a classic American Broadway style. 'Hello, Young Lovers' for example, though perhaps a little untraditional in some ways as I will go into in a moment, follows many norms of early Broadway orchestration, such a very legato strings-oriented ornamentation. It also takes cues from opera with its opening expositional recitative passage, before moving into the aria (in the expected AABA structure).

Figure 2; Structure of *Hello, Young Lovers*
Recitative | bars 1-24
Aria:
A (10 bars) | bars 25-34

B (16 bars) | bars 45-60

Coda (8 bars) | bars 71-78

Indeed, this song could be categorised as a charm song (as defined by Laird [-@lairdMusicalStylesSong2011](-@lairdMusicalStylesSong2011.md)), with some elements of ballad and, in some ways, the 'I am'/'I want' song style. It is through 'Hello, Young Lovers' that the audiences learns of Anna's past marriage, which influences her optimistic perspective in the aria addressed both to the King's wives and the audience themselves. Anna's opening recitative is more personal and reflective, filled with rubato and rhythms of natural speech. Then, the aria's movement between 6/8 and 3/4 gives it a lilting, waltz feel, a traditional way to portray the theme of love in the Golden Age of Broadway [@lairdMusicalStylesSong2011](Uni%20Work/YEAR%203/SS%20Diss%20(Ludo)/Reading%20notes/@lairdMusicalStylesSong2011.md).

Contrastingly, the musical's ballet 'The Small House of Uncle Thomas' most exaggerates Rodgers' perceived Eastern soundworld. The sequence itself opens with a gong and bells, immediately establishing the tone. The chorus chant, dubbed *quasi parlando* in the score, is metronomically rigid, with high vocal inflections at the start/end of some notes (e.g. "Sto-wa"). Instrumental interludes, for example preceding the first "Poor Eliza" chant, follow an entirely pentatonic note palette on Western percussion instruments[^4].
Another way in which Rodgers and Hammerstein attempt to make East Asian culture accessible is by generally equating buddhism to a monotheistic religion (namely, Christianity) — most obvious in 'Small House of Uncle Thomas', the Buddha is interpolated into entirely Christian sentiments in substitute for a Christian god ("Praise to Buddha").


It is the more universal themes such as love that give Rodgers' and Hammerstein's musicals their timeless quality. The setting of *TK&I* could be any country other than a Western one( in order to portray the superiority complex of our Western protagonist) and the plot could remain the same.
While the musical remains a product of its time in several ways, with many of these resultant cultural manifestations deeply embedded into its construction (in all aspects of a musical's stimuli, but in particular the musical score), it's charming appeal ultimately comes from its engaging characters and humanisation of its themes. Love is presented in all kinds of complex varieties, but it is our protagonist, Anna, that sets the moral standard and even encourages the audience directly to give in to romantic sensibilities.

[^2]: For context, the prime minister is described to be "half-clothed" in this scene. %% page number? %%
[^3]: To give some clarity, the traditions that Anna criticises in this song are, for the most part, of a harmful nature. I expand more on the high-ground granted inherently to Anna to present these arguments further on.
[^4]: As Morton [-@morton1976traditional](@morton1976traditional.md) notes, the idea of East Asian music following a basic pentatonic scale is an oversimplification, and the standard tuning of Western instruments can never reflect the true sound used in Siamese music specifically.
[^5]: It is constant exaggeration of the Siamese and their juxtaposed traditions that is used comedically throughout.
