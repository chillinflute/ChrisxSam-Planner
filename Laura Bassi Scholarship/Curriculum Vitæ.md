## Editorial Experience

### JSMG Guest Editor

Currently co-editing an edition of the *Journal of Sound and Music in Games* on the music of Supergiant Games' *Hades* alongside Stephanie Lind, Demetrius Shahmehri, and Silvia Mantilla-Wright. [Call for papers](https://www.sssmg.org/wp/2022/11/08/call-for-proposals-hades-special-issue-for-jsmg/) has just elapsed and we are now in the process of processing abstracts. Future responsibilities will involved liasing with peer-reviewers as well as editing to the Journal's house style.  

### Freelance copy-editor

Working freelance through online services including UpWork and Paperound since 2019, I've had experience editting and proof-reading a wide range of work including journalistic pieces and academic whitepapers, in a range of subjects from the arts to STEM.

### University of Birmingham Academic Writing Advisory Service

As an Academic Writing Advisor for UoB's AWAS service, I reviewed undergraduate and postgraduate written pieces and provided feedback to help students improve their writing, focussing on helping them optimise their writing style for concision and clarity of argument, as well as checking for common language and grammar errors. Whilst I was designated as AWAS's music specialist, I frequently worked with students from other disciplines including those on law and sciences degrees.

Whilst working with AWAS I wrote material on best-practice methods of writing musical analyses in word-processors, which can be more limiting than marking up a score by hand. This included a guide on utilising $\TeX{}$ and its derivatives, especially MathJax due to how well it works with various conventional word-processors (including my personal favourite note-taker: Obsidian), in order to produce symbols that are impractical or impossible with regular text, such as figured bass $\left(\substack{6 \\ 5 \\ ♯3}\right)$, specific references to subdivided beats within a bar using nested subscripts $\left(4_{2_3}\right)$,
