*What role does ethnomusicology play in shaping understandings of human existence (or human experience) in contemporary society?*

*In your response, suggest a provable thesis that answers this question;*
- *draw on readings for at least three lectures over the course of the second half of the term (A. Cannon's lectures);*
- *find a selection of new readings and performances and evaluate them;*
- *and undertake music analysis of at least one performance in the essay.*

*Since this is only 1500 words, it is important for the essay to be precise, concise, and especially well organised.*

## intro
Much of the world remains to be investigated ethnomusicologically: %%why%%. One culture that has yet to see extensive research or thorough examination of its musical traditions is Malta. Malta provides an interesting, relatively untapped example: the intersectionality of different cultures that Malta consists of due to its geographical location and history of rulers means that its folk music draws from and develops on other varied traditions. These different influences have come to create a "sonic signature" of Malta through the hybridisation of various other folk styles. Often referred to in the European world as the "gateway to Africa", Malta has historically been considered strategically placed for as both a trade and military outpost. Due to its being on the edge of several broader cultural communities (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Middle East, North Africa), this has lead to a status of intersecting cultural spheres, thus affecting the traditions developed there.

In proving this thesis, a concentration on how cultural and national identity is cultivated through the means of music will be required. [some bullshit]


- Previous rule of lots of different countries/organisations — The Byzantines, Knights of St John %%not a country%%, the French, the English — yet influences seem to draw predominantly from Arabic & North African musical traditions ([[@chircopOralTraditionHistorical1993|Chircop, 1993]])
- Were not forcibly colonised by the English — the English helped them fight the French, and so were welcomed to assume the island as a protectorate 
- British rule began in about 1800; as an anciently multicultural nation, Malta had already developed many of its musical traditions from previous inhabitors
- independent since 1974
-> ==how might ethnomusicologists study this==

As stated, in brief, Malta has been under rule from a variety of nations and organisations — to list just a few, this includes the Byzantine Empire, the Knights of St John (who in of themselves were a massively multicultural group), England, and France. Malta is a profoundly ancient nation, having been a popular choice for strategic rules, thus leading to a long history of multiculturalism. 

## how creativity & identity might yield "sonic signature"
fuck if i know

## one or more practices that prove the power of sonic signature
use a recording here
i know the practices well enough that i'll know which exhibit my points once i have points

## conclusion

While Malta certainly has its own distinctive musical tradition and identity, its identity in the wider world has little cognitive associations to the average person. Much of the ethnoresearch conducted in Malta has not seen much of a global stage, with this partly being due to the closeted nature of traditional music in the country ([[@mcleodBormlizaMalteseFolksong1975|McLeod and Herndon, 1975]]). 


#### kieran's tips
- use evidence
- expand on specific cultural advantages
- be detailed on details of other musical cultures
- tie examples together thematically
