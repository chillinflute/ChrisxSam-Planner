## intro
Much of the world remains to be investigated ethnomusicologically. One location that has yet to see extensive research or thorough examination of its musical traditions is Malta. Malta provides an interesting, relatively untapped example: the intersectionality of different cultures that Malta consists of due to its geographical location and previous rule means that its folk music draws from and develops on other traditions. These different influences have come to create a "sonic signature" of Malta through the hybridisation of various other folk styles.

This thesis requires huge concentration on cultural and national identity, through the means of music. [some bullshit]

## historical bullshit
- Previous rule of lots of different countries — Byzantian, Knights of St John, the French, the English — yet influences seem to draw predominantly from Arabic & North African musical traditions ([[@chircopOralTraditionHistorical1993|Chircop, 1993]])
- Were not forcibly colonised by the English — the English helped them fight the French, and so were welcomed to assume sovereignty over the island
- British rule began in about 1800; as an anciently multicultural nation, Malta had already developed many of its musical traditions from previous inhabitors
-> ==how might ethnomusicologists study this==

## how creativity & identity might yield "sonic signature"
fuck if i know

## one or more practices that prove the power of sonic signature

## conclusion
While Malta certainly has its own distinctive musical tradition and identity, its identity in the international world has little cognitive associations to the average person. Much of the ethnoresearch conducted in Malta has not seen much of a global stage, with this partly being due to the closeted nature of traditional music in the country ([[@mcleodBormlizaMalteseFolksong1975|McLeod and Herndon, 1975]]).
