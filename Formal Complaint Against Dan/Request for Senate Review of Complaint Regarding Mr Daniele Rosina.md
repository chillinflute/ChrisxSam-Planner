I am herein making an official request for a Senate Review of a formal complaint made against Mr Daniele Rosina, Head of Orchestral Studies and conductor as part of the University of Birmingham Music Society (hereon: UoBMS, or simply "Music Society"). Having gone through the formal complaints procedure, involving the supplying of a statement, witness testimony, and dialogue with the Investigating Officer (IO) Prof. Aengus Ward, and receipt of the Response from School of Languages, Culture, Art, History, and Music (LCAHM), I am dissatisfied with the conclusions and recommendations of this complaint. Therefore, I am making this request for a Senate Review of this complaint according to the [[cop-student-concerns-complaints-20-21.pdf|Code of Practice on Student Concerns and Complaints]] (attached, hereon CoPSCC).

For the reference of the reader, I will refer throughout to relevant documents which shall be attached, by page numbers and/or section headings and bullet points (§, •) where appropriate. 

The issues taken with the Response provided by the IO are given on the [[Review Panel Form Christopher Hill.doc|Senate Review Panel Submission Form]] (SRPSF), but are listed below in brief:

1. The IO fails to apply the Reasonableness Test described in the [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=6|University's Harrassment and Bullying Policy (hereon HBP) §5.2]].
2. Whilst communication with the IO was thorough throughout, the nature of that communication meant that I was not provided with the opportunity to supply relevant information to the IO that I believe would have impacted the conclusions drawn in the School's response.
3. I have multiple concerns over the handling and communication of witnesses for both parties and their statements; including which witnesses were and were not considered, and the standard for witnesses and evidence being unequal for complainant and complainee.
4. There are in the IO's report: multiple factual errors, allegations stated as facts, an overall lack of precision regarding witness testimony, and occassions where accounts of events are presented from Mr Rosina's (and presumably his witnesses') viewpoint with no contrast against mine (and my witnesses') own, and no assertion of supporting evidence to justify taking Mr Rosina's and co.'s version of events over mine and my witnesses' own.
5. There is a general lack of sense of contrition by Mr Rosina for the substance of his actions, only merely for the manner of communication of them. 

This document will detail these issues one by one in a depth better suited to a standalone document than the limited space available in the [[Review Panel Form Christopher Hill.doc|SRPSF]].  

## Regarding the IO

I would like it known that I have no personal complaint against the IO. Throughout the course of this process they were exemplary in their kindness and consideration of my case, and discussions with them were as pleasant as a discussion of such a distressing nature could be reasonably made to be, and they were particularly good at detailing the steps of the formal process. The nature of my complaint here regarding their report is purely to do with what I see as failings of the report produced by them, matters of the process of producing said report, and what I see as logical (and procedural) failings in the content of that report.  

# Regarding the "Test of Reasonableness"

Quoting [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=7|HBP§7.3]]:

> When considering allegations of bullying, the University will apply the test of ‘reasonableness’ to determine if bullying has taken place. The test will be applied as outlined in paragraphs 5.1- 5.2 above with due regard in particular to the perception of the Complainant and whether the behaviour in question could reasonably be considered to undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the Complainant.

Unfortunately, these principles do not appear to have been considered within the
