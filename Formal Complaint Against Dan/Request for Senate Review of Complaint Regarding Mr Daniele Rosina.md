I am herein making an official request for a Senate Review of a formal complaint made against Mr Daniele Rosina, Head of Orchestral Studies and conductor as part of the University of Birmingham Music Society (hereon: UoBMS, or simply "Music Society"). Having gone through the formal complaints procedure, involving the supplying of a statement, witness testimony, and dialogue with the Investigating Officer (IO) Prof. Aengus Ward, and receipt of the Response from School of Languages, Culture, Art, History, and Music (LCAHM), I am dissatisfied with the conclusions and recommendations of this complaint. Therefore, I am making this request for a Senate Review of this complaint according to the [[cop-student-concerns-complaints-20-21.pdf|Code of Practice on Student Concerns and Complaints]] (attached).

For the reference of the reader, I will refer throughout to relevant documents which shall be attached, by page numbers and/or section headings and bullet points (ยง, โข) where appropriate. 

The issues taken with the Response provided by the IO are given on the [[Review Panel Form Christopher Hill.doc|Senate Review Panel Submission Form]], but are listed below in brief:

1. The IO fails to apply the Reasonableness Test described in the University's Harrassment and Bullying Policy (hereon HBP) ยง5.2
2. Whilst communication with the IO was thorough throughout, the nature of that communication meant that I was not provided with the opportunity to supply relevant information to the IO that I believe would have impacted the conclusions drawn in the School's response.
3.
