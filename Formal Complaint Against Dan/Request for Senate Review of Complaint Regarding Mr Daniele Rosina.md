I am herein making an official request for a Senate Review of a formal complaint made against Mr Daniele Rosina, Head of Orchestral Studies and conductor as part of the University of Birmingham Music Society (hereon: UoBMS, or simply "Music Society"). Having gone through the formal complaints procedure, involving the supplying of a statement, witness testimony, and dialogue with the Investigating Officer (IO) Prof. Aengus Ward, and receipt of the Response (hereon: "the report" or "the response" or "IO Report") from School of Languages, Culture, Art, History, and Music (LCAHM), I am dissatisfied with the conclusions and recommendations of this complaint. Therefore, I am making this request for a Senate Review of this complaint according to the [[cop-student-concerns-complaints-20-21.pdf|Code of Practice on Student Concerns and Complaints]] (attached, hereon CoPSCC).

For the reference of the reader, I will refer throughout to relevant documents which shall be attached, by page numbers and/or section headings and bullet points (§, •) where appropriate. 

The issues taken with the Response provided by the IO are given on the [[Review Panel Form Christopher Hill.doc|Senate Review Panel Submission Form]] (SRPSF), but are listed below in brief:

1. The IO fails to apply the Reasonableness Test described in the [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=6|University's harassment and Bullying Policy (hereon HBP) §5.2]].
2. Whilst communication with the IO was thorough throughout, the nature of that communication meant that I was not provided with the opportunity to supply relevant information to the IO that I believe would have impacted the conclusions drawn in the School's response.
3. I have multiple concerns over the handling and communication of witnesses for both parties and their statements; including which witnesses were and were not considered, and the standard for witnesses and evidence being unequal for complainant and complainee.
4. There are in the IO's report: multiple factual errors, allegations stated as facts, an overall lack of precision regarding witness testimony, and occassions where accounts of events are presented from Mr Rosina's (and presumably his witnesses') viewpoint with no contrast against mine (and my witnesses') own, and no assertion of supporting evidence to justify taking Mr Rosina's and co.'s version of events over mine and my witnesses' own.
5. There is a general lack of sense of contrition by Mr Rosina for the substance of his actions, only merely for the manner of communication of them. 

This document will detail these issues one by one in a depth better suited to a standalone document than the limited space available in the [[Review Panel Form Christopher Hill.doc|SRPSF]].  

## Regarding the IO

I would like it known that I have no personal complaint against the IO. Throughout the course of this process they were exemplary in their kindness and consideration of my case, and discussions with them were as pleasant as a discussion of such a distressing nature could be reasonably made to be, and they were particularly good at detailing the steps of the formal process, and being considerate of the factors that could help me navigate the process in accordance with my [[Chris Hill Reasonable Adjustment Plan.pdf|RAP]]. The nature of my complaint here regarding their report is purely to do with what I see as failings of the report produced by them, matters of the process of producing said report, and what I see as logical and procedural failings in the content of that report.  

# Regarding the "Test of Reasonableness"

Quoting [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=7|HBP§7.3]]:

> When considering allegations of bullying, the University will apply the test of ‘reasonableness’ to determine if bullying has taken place. The test will be applied as outlined in paragraphs 5.1- 5.2 above with due regard in particular to the perception of the Complainant and whether the behaviour in question could reasonably be considered to undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the Complainant.

Unfortunately, these principles do not appear to have been implemented when assessing whether or not bullying had occurred by Mr Rosina towards myself. This fundamentally alters the IO's assessment of whether or not the actions requested as redress can be undertaken. Furthermore, the language of the IO's report indicates that they did at least consider some form of test of reasonableness in their assessment of the situation, yet fails to acknowledge that the passing of such a test indicates that the alleged bullying under consideration had indeed occurred.

There are multiple points where this is evident in the report:

> It is not clear that this event *per se* constitutes a breach of the bullying policy, though given the combination of events mentioned, it may be reasonable that Mr. Hill felt that it did. — [[Christopher Hill complaint School final.pdf#page=4|IO Report, pg. 4]]

> It is not clear that the incident was intended to undermine, humiliate etc. Mr. Hill, although he may reasonably have experienced it this way. — [[Christopher Hill complaint School final.pdf#page=5|IO Report, pg. 5]]

> While the student does indeed have a protected characteristic, and associated RAP, there is no direct evidence to suggest that the conduct which is the subject of the complaint is directly related to it; as a result, the incidents cannot themselves be considered harassment. However, they may certainly have been experienced as something similar by Mr. Hill. — [[Christopher Hill complaint School final.pdf#page=6|IO Report, pg. 6]]

In these cases, an acknowledgement is cleary made that I, as the complainant, could reasonably interpret Mr Rosina's conduct as Bullying, Victimisation, or Harrassement. This, by the definitions defined in HBP, would seem to thus concur that by a reasonableness test such conduct could be considered as such. However, the IO instead refers repeatedly for a "test" or "threshold" of Bullying, Victimisation, or Harrassement — a bar for which they do not believe this conduct exceeds [[Christopher Hill complaint School final.pdf#page=5|(HBP pgs. 5 & 6)]]. 

Unless there is some form of threshold undocumented within the [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf|HBP]], it can only be assumed that this test is referring to the definition the IO cites on the [[Christopher Hill complaint School final.pdf#page=5|IO Report pg. 5]] referring to [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=6|HBP§6.1]]. If this is the case I must respectfully disagree that the incidents described do not meet this criteria, and I give exact references to the examples given in the [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf|HBP]] in my original [[Formal Complaint Against Mr Daniele Rosina.pdf#page=3|Formal Complaint (pgs. 3-9)]] for each incident cited, clearly illustrating how each example meets the description of Bullying and/or Victimisation as defined in the [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf|HBP]]. 

Therefore the IO is, in the course of the report, presenting a contradiction. On the one hand, I have highlighted exactly the ways in which I allege I have been Bullied, Harassed, etc. by Mr Rosina, with specific cross-reference to the [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf|HBP]]. The IO has confirmed that it may be reasonable that I should perceive Mr Rosina's as such. Simultaneously, they maintain that the conduct does not meet the standard to qualify as such. These two positions are directly contradictory, as laid out by the definition of these terms in the [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf|HBP]]. 

## Concerning Harassment

It should be pointed out that in my [[Formal Complaint Against Mr Daniele Rosina|Formal Complaint]] I only ever allege Harassment by Mr Rosina **in terms of** Victimisation [[Formal Complaint Against Mr Daniele Rosina|(pg. 9)]], since Victimisation is unlawful under harassment and discrimination legislature [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=8|(HBP§8.3)]]. The IO seems to have centered their understanding of the Harassment complaint instead according to my protected characteristics [[Christopher Hill complaint School final.pdf#page=6|(IO Report pg. 6)]] and associated [[Chris Hill Reasonable Adjustment Plan.pdf|RAP]], which was not the central point of my argument. I did recall an event to the IO where I felt that I was being demeaned because of that protected characteristic, but noted at the time that I hadn't included it in the [[Formal Complaint Against Mr Daniele Rosina|Formal Complaint]] because I knew I would not have the supporting evidence for that particular incident, which was why I had focussed my complaint on the incidents where I believed Bullying and Victimisation to have clearly taken place, and where I had ample enough evidence to support such a claim. 

Crucially, according to the definition of Victimisation according to the [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=7|HBP§8]], there is no requirement that the complainant have any particular protected characteristic, only that the complainee believes them to "intend to make such an allegation" [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=7|(HBP§8.1)]]. Considering that Mr Rosina alleges that in Incident 3 I "made allegations of favouritism" [[Christopher Hill complaint School final.pdf#page=4|(IO Report pg. 4)]] against him — a charge that would certainly qualify a complaint of Harassment if true — he could reasonably expect that I would make a complaint. It is my belief that what followed in that confrontation, specifically regarding his threatening to bar me from the orchestra for the coming term as well as his generally threatening and agressive demeanor, was Victimisation and an attempt to scare me into not making such a complaint for fear of losing my position (as I describe in my [[Formal Complaint Against Mr Daniele Rosina#9|Formal Complaint pg. 9]]).
