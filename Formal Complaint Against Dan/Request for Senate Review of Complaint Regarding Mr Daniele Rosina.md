I am herein making an official request for a Senate Review of a formal complaint made against Mr Daniele Rosina, Head of Orchestral Studies and conductor as part of the University of Birmingham Music Society (hereon: UoBMS, or simply "Music Society"). Having gone through the formal complaints procedure, involving the supplying of a statement, witness testimony, and dialogue with the Investigation Officer (IO) Prof. Aengus Ward, and receipt of the Response from School of Languages, Culture, Art, History, and Music (LCAHM), I am dissatisfied with the conclusions and recommendations of this complaint. Therefore, I am making this request for a Senate Review of this complaint according to the [[cop-student-concerns-complaints-20-21.pdf|Code of Practice on Student Concerns and Complaints]] (attached)
