# Proposal

The proposal is to, in partnership with an appropriate member/s of committee, establish a group within the Music Society with the purpose of providing a space for students to discover and discuss musicological topics. This would serve to supplement the musicological studies of music students through their courses, whilst also opening up the discovery and study of musicological topics to students studying different courses, and interested members of the community. 

The establishment of such a group would benefit the interests, and further the stated goals, of the UoBMS in the following ways:

1. It would provide a forum for students to informally, collaboratively, and supportively share ideas.
2. It would provide a locus for the exploration of musicological topics that aren't neccessarily coverred within the normal course of a taught degree at the University
