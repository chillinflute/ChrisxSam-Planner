I am herein making a formal complaint against Mr Daniele Rosina, Director of Orchestral Studies and conductor within the University of Birmingham Music Society, wherein he holds several positions of leadership and authority. This complaint is made on the grounds of **bullying**, and **victimisation**, experienced most severely during the previous academic year (2021-2022), especially during interactions as a member of the Philharmonic Orchestra which he conducts, and as described within the University of Birmingham's *[[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf|Harassment and Bullying Policy]]*, which is attached to this complaint. To contextualise my grievances with the conduct of Mr Rosina within the framework of this policy, I will refer to section headings of this document throughout. 

# Rationale for Formal Complaint as Course of Action

As described in [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§11.2]], in the first instance of being subject to the grievances described below I attempted to seek informal routes of resolution. As per [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§11.3]], I consulted with members of the Music Office, including Gavin Allsop, Rachel Gibson, and Jo Sweet. My primary point of contact at the time was Rachel Gibson, who is no longer an employee of the University. In conversations with her, and in accordance with [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§11.3]], I described the events that had taken place, often within an hour of them occurring. These accounts were recorded on pen and paper and kept, to the best of my knowledge, according to [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§11.3]]. I was advised to make a formal complaint should I see fit. 

I acknowledge the various informal courses of action documented within [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§12]], however have concluded (as is my prerogative by [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§12.1]]) that these would be inappropriate to my situation. Indeed, I have been informally advised by staff that directly engaging with Mr Rosina in order to discuss this would likely only make the situation worse. 

It is notable that there has been a notable gap of time between my last problematic encounter with Mr Rosina and my submission of this complaint. The reasons for which are as follows:

1. I was concerned about potential repercussions for me should I submit this complaint. Despite reassurances in [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9||§11.1]], Mr Rosina is, as one online article puts it, a man ["blessed with important musical contacts"](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/When+Daniele%27s+not+working+he%27s+networking%3B+Conductor+Daniele+Rosina...-a0166020245). I am not a confrontational person generally, and relevant staff will attest to how nervous I was when first coming forward about what I was experiencing. Advancing to the degree of making a formal complaint is an undertaking I make with great reluctance, however given 

Given the profound effect that these grievances have had on my personal wellbeing and professional opportunities as a postgraduate member of the University, I am following the guidance according to [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=12|§13.4]] and submitting the **Concern Review form** attached.
