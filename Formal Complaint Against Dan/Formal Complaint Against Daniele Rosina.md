I am herein making a formal complaint against Mr Daniele Rosina, Director of Orchestral Studies and conductor within the University of Birmingham Music Society, wherein he holds several positions of leadership and authority. This complaint is made on the grounds of **bullying**, and **victimisation**, experienced most severely during the previous academic year (2021-2022), especially during interactions as a member of the Philharmonic Orchestra which he conducts, and as described within the University of Birmingham's *[[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf|Harassment and Bullying Policy]]*, which is attached to this complaint. To contextualise my grievances with the conduct of Mr Rosina within the framework of this policy, I will refer to section headings of this document throughout. 

# Rationale for Formal Complaint as Course of Action

As described in [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§11.2]], in the first instance of being subject to the grievances described below I attempted to seek informal routes of resolution. As per [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§11.3]], I consulted with members of the Music Office, including Gavin Allsop, Rachel Gibson, and Jo Sweet. My primary point of contact at the time was Rachel Gibson, who is no longer an employee of the University. In conversations with her, and in accordance with [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§11.3]], I described the events that had taken place, often within an hour of them occurring. These accounts were recorded on pen and paper and kept, to the best of my knowledge, according to [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§11.3]]. I was advised to make a formal complaint should I see fit. 

I acknowledge the various informal courses of action documented within [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§12]]. Indeed, measures in line with [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=10|§12.3]] were undertaken in one particular occasion detailed below, however the resolution of those steps did not result in a satisfactory conclusion. However, due to Mr Rosina's exceptionally confrontational behaviour in past encounters — indeed, I have been informally advised by staff that directly engaging with Mr Rosina in order to discuss this would likely only make the situation worse — I have concluded (as is my prerogative by [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9|§12.1]]) that these avenues would be inappropriate to my situation at this point. 

It is notable that there has been a notable gap of time between my last problematic encounter with Mr Rosina and my submission of this complaint. The reasons for which are as follows:

1. I was concerned about potential repercussions for me should I submit this complaint. Despite reassurances in [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=9||§11.1]], Mr Rosina is, as one online article puts it, a man ["blessed with important musical contacts"](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/When+Daniele%27s+not+working+he%27s+networking%3B+Conductor+Daniele+Rosina...-a0166020245). I am not a confrontational person generally, and relevant staff will attest to how distressed I was when first coming forward about what I was experiencing. Advancing to the degree of making a formal complaint is an undertaking I make with great reluctance, and with a great degree of concern for the repercussions I could face socially and professionally for doing so.
	1. It has come to my attention since the events of the last academic year, from numerous sources, some of whom must remain anonymous, that they have witnessed and/or suffered similar mistreatment by Mr Rosina, the majority of whom confessed that they were similarly retiscent to speak out about their experiences for fear of said professional or social repercussions. Since this behaviour is clearly not limited to me as an individual, and indeed might be seen to exhibit a pattern of behaviour, it seemed all the more important that the events of last academic year were brought to light.
2. Over the course of this academic year, the effects of the **victimisation** I have endured since last year have prevented me from being as active a member of the Music Society, and thus the University community, as I would wish to be. As a member of the PGR community, and as someone undertaking a Performance Practice PhD especially, I have a right to be able to engage with the musical activities of the University to the fullest of my abilities. However, my experiences with Mr Rosina have made it all but impossible to do so, for fear of repercussions and of the risk of suffering the same detriment to my emotional and physical wellbeing that I have in the past experienced.

Given the profound effect that these grievances have had on my personal wellbeing and professional opportunities as a postgraduate member of the University, I am following the guidance according to [[University of Birmingham bullying.pdf#page=12|§13.4]] and submitting the **Concern Review form** attached.

# The Grievances

## Bullying

#### Incident 1

#### Incident 2

A late scheduling confirmation for orchestral rehearsals meant that rehearsals were scheduled in such a way that clashed with my teaching obligations for non-profit organisation [The Brilliant Club](https://thebrilliantclub.org), with whom I was employed as a part-time tutor. I was being paid to teach online lessons to GCSE-year students, and in this instance I was helping prepare students for their GCSE Maths exams. With exams so imminent, and having to work within a busy school timetable, these lessons could not be moved. I knew I would have to miss a portion of the orchestral rehearsal. 

Knowing how Mr Rosina was liable to react to my being unable to attend part of the re
