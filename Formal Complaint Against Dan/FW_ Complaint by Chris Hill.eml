Dear Sam,

Yes, thank you for that. This is more than enough detail, so thank you very=
 much for being so thorough. I'll make sure I go through it very carefully =
and if there is anything else that occurs to me for clarification, I'll get=
 back in touch.

Thanks again for your time.

Subject: Re: Complaint by Chris Hill


Hi Aengus,



Thank you for your email. Yes, I have spoken to Chris at length about this =
situation and am happy to give you my account of last year=92s events.



I wrote quite a thorough statement for Chris=92s formal complaint document =
(I believe mine is the first one, Appendix 1), though at the time I was hop=
ing to keep my name anonymous; I thought giving a statement for Chris might=
 affect my potential involvement in one of the university=92s orchestras, a=
nd for the foreseeable should I want a performance career. I am also on the=
 Music Society Committee, and so feel obligated as such to keep any relatio=
nship with Mr Rosina cordial. However, if this is the only way in which the=
 system will allow me to give my account then so be it. I can only hope tha=
t your investigation will mitigate those risks.



The statement I have already written is in Chris=92s big complaint document=
, as I say =97 it was more an attempt to summarise the effects I had seen i=
n Chris over the year than an exact account of the events (I was not in the=
 orchestra last year, after all, and so witnessed a limited amount of Mr Ro=
sina=92s behaviour), but I am more than happy to precisely describe what I =
witnessed on the days in question. I will try to be as thorough as I can, s=
o I apologise for any overlap with my previous statement.



The events of 6th June were the clearest incidence in which I saw Mr Rosina=
=92s harassment. I was hoping to catch Chris before he had to dash off afte=
r orchestra rehearsal, just so I could greet him as it was his birthday. He=
=92d confided in me that he had been worried before the rehearsal about nee=
ding to leave it promptly as he had a CBSO Chorus rehearsal afterwards, and=
 since they awarded him a bursary to take part, it was important that he ge=
t there in time (I think orchestra finished at 6:30pm and his next rehearsa=
l started at 6:45pm at the CBSO Centre, so there just wasn=92t enough time =
for Chris to arrive punctually even if he did leave immediately). When it r=
eached 6:45pm and Chris still hadn=92t come out of the Elgar (several other=
 orchestra members had left, but not Chris), I was getting concerned, so I =
went into the hall to see if he was alright. I opened the door to the hall =
and Chris and Mr Rosina were right there in a very heated exchange. I don=
=92t remember many details of the conversation as I was a bit taken aback a=
nd didn=92t wish to interrupt, but the manner of each of them was quite cle=
ar: Mr Rosina seemed very accusatory and agitated, whereas Chris more calm =
but somewhat exasperated. The only exact comment I can recall is something =
to the effect of Mr Rosina asking Chris if he was accusing him of favouriti=
sm and Chris dismissing this, seeming in a hurry to leave. I thought it bes=
t that I leave the hall again, not really knowing the context and not wanti=
ng any part in the confrontation.

                While I waited outside again, there was a further 5 minutes=
 before Chris emerged, in which time I spoke to a few members of the orches=
tra who had seen the events of the rehearsal (and the ongoing interaction a=
s they departed) and expressed sympathy for Chris, despite Chris, as a post=
grad, not being particularly socially integrated with them. When Chris fina=
lly walked out, he was visibly very upset and frustrated; it took several o=
f us to speak to him and reassure him before he was in any state to cycle (=
these were mostly Chris=92s friends and I, Amira Campbell and Mark Mingard =
were also there and were the only ones willing to give their names when Chr=
is began writing his complaint =97 there were at least a further three memb=
ers of orchestra present but I don=92t think I can give their names, as the=
y didn=92t want to be involved with Chris=92s complaint in case it jeopardi=
sed their position in orchestra, or, indeed, their professional careers). W=
e were very conscious of Chris=92s bike accident a few months prior and wer=
e determined that he didn=92t leave until he was in a better frame of mind,=
 which took somewhere between 10 and 40 minutes (I wasn=92t checking the cl=
ock naturally, but I recall because I had a rehearsal at 8pm and Chris had =
only definitely departed half an hour or so before that).

The whole fiasco left Chris very bothered and upset =97 we discussed it lat=
er that evening after both of our rehearsals had ended, and Chris decided h=
e would recount the events to Rachael Gibson the following day. I was prese=
nt for this meeting, as moral support. I believe the result of this meeting=
 was a little vague: Chris was advised to avoid Mr Rosina as much as was po=
ssible (despite the biweekly, then practically daily, rehearsals the week o=
f the concert), and it was implied that Mr Rosina would be spoken to about =
the incident. I imagine a more precise minutes of the meeting was taken, as=
 Rachael did take notes to put on the University Music system.



I have less to recount, really, about June 24th; I did not witness any of M=
r Rosina=92s behaviour, I can only testify to the state it left Chris in af=
terwards. I was holding a workspace for Chris in the Bramall, so that when =
Chris left the rehearsal (to my memory, he had had to leave early to teach,=
 but had sorted all of this through Gavin) he could immediately attend to h=
is teaching commitments, which he delivered over Zoom. Due to this, when Ch=
ris had again not appeared in good time, I couldn=92t really leave the work=
 area, as it would only delay Chris further when he did arrive. Finally Chr=
is appeared, a few minutes after I expected him, and I can honestly say I=
=92ve never seen him so anxious, humiliated and distressed =97 he had a pan=
ic attack at this point. All I could do was comfort him, help him to breath=
e, and hope to get him into his lesson in enough of a composed state to get=
 through it, as there wasn=92t time to discuss it yet and I knew some of Ch=
ris=92s concern was due to his role as a tutor and not wanting to let down =
his pupils. I sat opposite Chris as he taught his lesson, then we discussed=
 the events of the rehearsal (I won=92t go into the events themselves, as I=
 did not bear witness to them and I imagine Chris has already described the=
m to you): he expressed his mental exhaustion, frustration and desperately =
not wanting to perform in the concert that evening as a result of this but =
feeling obliged to, and we, again, decided that he should speak to Rachael =
about what had happened, who then persuaded him that he should perform but,=
 again, avoid Mr Rosina at all costs. I couldn=92t attend the concert, as I=
 had been ill with COVID recently, but I heard that there were no further c=
onfrontations.

                This was the end of the direct incidents with Mr Rosina, to=
 my knowledge. I know Chris followed up with University Music, but they wer=
e limited in what they could do. All of this led to Chris deciding ultimate=
ly not to re-audition for his role as principal flute in orchestra again. I=
 may be biased, as we are close, but with two fellowships in flute performa=
nce and a long experience of playing in high-standard orchestras, it just s=
eems such a shame for the university orchestra to have lost out on such a p=
roficient player. Chris is probably too modest to have brought up to you ju=
st how skilled a player he is, but in my honest view, he is by far the most=
 qualified candidate for the role, which he had carried out for almost two =
years before this whole debacle. His performance standard aside, as a stude=
nt at the university, he should feel able to audition and take part in thes=
e ensembles, but the thought of last year=92s incidents continuing was enou=
gh for Chris to back out of the ensemble. In the end, I also ended up withd=
rawing my application for orchestra in September, as I was worried that pur=
ely by association I might be rejected/treated unfairly by Mr Rosina (this =
is a common feeling in the Music Society =97 again, I can=92t mention names=
 of people that don=92t want to be involved in this, but the orchestra has =
faced a problem where the most talented players are hesitant to audition du=
e to their knowledge that they are not liked by Mr Rosina). Chris and I are=
 also keen chamber musicians, playing in a saxophone quartet and as a duo, =
but due to these past incidents we haven=92t felt confident that should we =
take part in things like chamber platforms that only Mr Rosina presides ove=
r, we would get any valuable feedback.



I hope this is enough detail on the incidents in question, as well as the s=
ituation, as I understand it, since =97 if you have any other questions, I =
would be happy to answer them.



All the best,

Sam

Dear Sam (if I may),



I am Professor Aengus Ward, Deputy Head of School of the School of Language=
s, Cultures, Art History and Music here at the University of Birmingham. As=
 you may have heard, Dan Rosina is subject to a complaint made by a postgra=
duate student, and member of the University Orchestra, Chris Hill and I hav=
e been tasked to investigate. Chris has suggested I contact you as he says =
you were present on at least one of the occasions which give rise to the co=
mplaint =96 and in particular, the dress rehearsal for the university conce=
rt on 24th June last year. The substance of the complaint is that Dan engag=
ed in activity which can be construed as bullying and harassment of Chris H=
ill. I would be grateful if you were able to give me your view of the incid=
ent that occurred that day, and any other relevant information.



All the best,

<p class=3D"xmsonormal"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0pt">I wrote quite a th=
orough statement for Chris=92s formal complaint document (I believe mine is=
 the first one, Appendix 1), though at the time I was hoping to keep my nam=
e anonymous; I thought giving a statement
 for Chris might affect my potential involvement in one of the university=
=92s orchestras, and for the foreseeable should I want a performance career=
. I am also on the Music Society Committee, and so feel obligated as such t=
o keep any relationship with Mr Rosina
 cordial. However, if this is the only way in which the system will allow m=
e to give my account then so be it. I can only hope that your investigation=
 will mitigate those risks.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"xmsonormal"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0pt">The statement I ha=
ve already written is in Chris=92s big complaint document, as I say =97 it =
was more an attempt to summarise the effects I had seen in Chris over the y=
ear than an exact account of the events
 (I was not in the orchestra last year, after all, and so witnessed a limit=
ed amount of Mr Rosina=92s behaviour), but I am more than happy to precisel=
y describe what I witnessed on the days in question. I will try to be as th=
orough as I can, so I apologise for
 any overlap with my previous statement.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"xmsonormal"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0pt">The events of 6<su=
p>th</sup> June were the clearest incidence in which I saw Mr Rosina=92s ha=
rassment. I was hoping to catch Chris before he had to dash off after orche=
stra rehearsal, just so I could greet
 him as it was his birthday. He=92d confided in me that he had been worried=
 before the rehearsal about needing to leave it promptly as he had a CBSO C=
horus rehearsal afterwards, and since they awarded him a bursary to take pa=
rt, it was important that he get there
 in time (I think orchestra finished at 6:30pm and his next rehearsal start=
ed at 6:45pm at the CBSO Centre, so there just wasn=92t enough time for Chr=
is to arrive punctually even if he did leave immediately). When it reached =
6:45pm and Chris still hadn=92t come
 out of the Elgar (several other orchestra members had left, but not Chris)=
, I was getting concerned, so I went into the hall to see if he was alright=
. I opened the door to the hall and Chris and Mr Rosina were right there in=
 a very heated exchange. I don=92t
 remember many details of the conversation as I was a bit taken aback and d=
idn=92t wish to interrupt, but the manner of each of them was quite clear: =
Mr Rosina seemed very accusatory and agitated, whereas Chris more calm but =
somewhat exasperated. The only exact
 comment I can recall is something to the effect of Mr Rosina asking Chris =
if he was accusing him of favouritism and Chris dismissing this, seeming in=
 a hurry to leave. I thought it best that I leave the hall again, not reall=
y knowing the context and not wanting
 any part in the confrontation.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"xmsonormal"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wh=
ile I waited outside again, there was a further 5 minutes before Chris emer=
ged, in which time I spoke to a few members of the orchestra who had seen t=
he events of the rehearsal (and the
 ongoing interaction as they departed) and expressed sympathy for Chris, de=
spite Chris, as a postgrad, not being particularly socially integrated with=
 them. When Chris finally walked out, he was visibly very upset and frustra=
ted; it took several of us to speak
 to him and reassure him before he was in any state to cycle (these were mo=
stly Chris=92s friends and I, Amira Campbell and Mark Mingard were also the=
re and were the only ones willing to give their names when Chris began writ=
ing his complaint =97 there were at
 least a further three members of orchestra present but I don=92t think I c=
an give their names, as they didn=92t want to be involved with Chris=92s co=
mplaint in case it jeopardised their position in orchestra, or, indeed, the=
ir professional careers). We were very
 conscious of Chris=92s bike accident a few months prior and were determine=
d that he didn=92t leave until he was in a better frame of mind, which took=
 somewhere between 10 and 40 minutes (I wasn=92t checking the clock natural=
ly, but I recall because I had a rehearsal
 at 8pm and Chris had only definitely departed half an hour or so before th=
at). </span>

<p class=3D"xmsonormal" style=3D"text-indent:36.0pt"><span style=3D"font-si=
ze:11.0pt">The whole fiasco left Chris very bothered and upset =97 we discu=
ssed it later that evening after both of our rehearsals had ended, and Chri=
s decided he would recount the events to
 Rachael Gibson the following day. I was present for this meeting, as moral=
 support. I believe the result of this meeting was a little vague: Chris wa=
s advised to avoid Mr Rosina as much as was possible (despite the biweekly,=
 then practically daily, rehearsals
 the week of the concert), and it was implied that Mr Rosina would be spoke=
n to about the incident. I imagine a more precise minutes of the meeting wa=
s taken, as Rachael did take notes to put on the University Music system.</=

<p class=3D"xmsonormal"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0pt">I have less to rec=
ount, really, about June 24<sup>th</sup>; I did not witness any of Mr Rosin=
a=92s behaviour, I can only testify to the state it left Chris in afterward=
s. I was holding a workspace for Chris
 in the Bramall, so that when Chris left the rehearsal (to my memory, he ha=
d had to leave early to teach, but had sorted all of this through Gavin) he=
 could immediately attend to his teaching commitments, which he delivered o=
ver Zoom. Due to this, when Chris
 had again not appeared in good time, I couldn=92t really leave the work ar=
ea, as it would only delay Chris further when he did arrive. Finally Chris =
appeared, a few minutes after I expected him, and I can honestly say I=92ve=
 never seen him so anxious, humiliated
 and distressed =97 he had a panic attack at this point. All I could do was=
 comfort him, help him to breathe, and hope to get him into his lesson in e=
nough of a composed state to get through it, as there wasn=92t time to disc=
uss it yet and I knew some of Chris=92s
 concern was due to his role as a tutor and not wanting to let down his pup=
ils. I sat opposite Chris as he taught his lesson, then we discussed the ev=
ents of the rehearsal (I won=92t go into the events themselves, as I did no=
t bear witness to them and I imagine
 Chris has already described them to you): he expressed his mental exhausti=
on, frustration and desperately not wanting to perform in the concert that =
evening as a result of this but feeling obliged to, and we, again, decided =
that he should speak to Rachael
 about what had happened, who then persuaded him that he should perform but=
, again, avoid Mr Rosina at all costs. I couldn=92t attend the concert, as =
I had been ill with COVID recently, but I heard that there were no further =
confrontations.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"xmsonormal"><span style=3D"font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Th=
is was the end of the direct incidents with Mr Rosina, to my knowledge. I k=
now Chris followed up with University Music, but they were limited in what =
they could do. All of this led to Chris
 deciding ultimately not to re-audition for his role as principal flute in =
orchestra again.&nbsp;I may be biased, as we are close, but with two fellow=
ships in flute performance and a long experience of playing in high-standar=
d orchestras, it just seems such a shame
 for the university orchestra to have lost out on such a proficient player.=
 Chris is probably too modest to have brought up to you just how skilled a =
player he is, but in my honest view, he is by far the most qualified candid=
ate for the role, which he had carried
 out for almost two years before this whole debacle. His performance standa=
rd aside, as a student at the university, he should feel able to audition a=
nd take part in these ensembles, but the thought of last year=92s incidents=
 continuing was enough for Chris to
 back out of the ensemble. In the end, I also ended up withdrawing my appli=
cation for orchestra in September, as I was worried that purely by associat=
ion I might be rejected/treated unfairly by Mr Rosina (this is a common fee=
ling in the Music Society =97 again,
 I can=92t mention names of people that don=92t want to be involved in this=
, but the orchestra has faced a problem where the most talented players are=
 hesitant to audition due to their knowledge that they are not liked by Mr =
Rosina). Chris and I are also keen chamber
 musicians, playing in a saxophone quartet and as a duo, but due to these p=
ast incidents we haven=92t felt confident that should we take part in thing=
s like chamber platforms that only Mr Rosina presides over, we would get an=
y valuable feedback.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

 give rise to the complaint =96 and in particular, the dress rehearsal for =
the university concert on 24<sup>th</sup> June last year. The substance of =
the complaint is that Dan engaged in activity which can be construed as bul=
