I completed an internship the summer before last, and had struggled in the last week or so of it in interactions with my co-workers. I had already worked the number of hours agreed per week in my contract, and had expressed (firmly but cordially) to a co-worker that I would be clocking out (having worked 9 hours that day, and 12 hours the previous day). The next day when I came into work, I was chastised by the same co-worker for not having worked that night, despite having set, in my view, a very reasonable and professional boundary. I apologised and tried to move on, as I didn't want any confrontation with the co-worker.

This made me quite upset, as I felt that my perceived value as a team member had gone down. I do feel that my co-worker was wrong to expect this of me. He knew the details of my contract, but still expected that the work should come first in my mind, even though I was only a month-long intern.

It was a challenging situation to have to advocate for myself. It was good that I was able to set the boundary in the first place, but not so good to have it challenged, and perhaps even worse that I simply let my co-worker disrespect it.

My co-worker probably did not feel he could set his own boundaries, as the company was struggling and this made everyone feel obligated to work all the time (it was also for a cause we were all passionate about). These factors were out of my control, and to some extent his as well.

I don't know whether I could have handled this better; the problem was ultimately the work ethic ingrained in every permanent member of staff, which was out of my control. Continuing to advocate for myself to my co-worker might have been a better outcome, but I am still proud that I was able to communicate clearly and respectfully throughout the situation, despite my frustrations.

If this were to happen again, I would still remain calm, but be less apologetic, and double down on the legality of my contract, and the necessity that I have downtime to be able to work effectively during my working hours. If it became a recurring incident, I would raise it with my boss.
