	- Long walk for anyone that doesn't live on the Vale (most of the members of our ensembles) - a coach or minibus, especially to transport people with large instruments, would make the day less tiring
	- Acoustics don't suit some of the pieces, especially the more high-tempo ones
	- Restricts rep for conductors (limited percussion, any additional players that play large instruments like harp)
	- It's excluding the Instrumental Choirs; sends a message that they don't want to showcase our ensembles like they do especially with auditioned ones
	- Even though it's nice to have another venue that we perform in, surely it doesn't always have to be the Instrumental Choirs performing there? Chamber Choirs would make more sense acoustics-wise
