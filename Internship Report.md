## Please provide an overall description of your role, activities and responsibilities during your internship.
Pre-festival, I was not given any particular ongoing responsibilities, I was mostly asked to do administrative tasks that needed doing, including: typing up and sending handwritten emails and to-do lists by the boss, working with large spreadsheets and sending out mailing list emails to artists and venues involved with the Jazz Festival. I also worked on developing promotional materials for some of the more unusual events running at the Festival, like the New Street Authors' readings. The event we ran called 'Jazz on the Tram' was also one that I assisted with the logistics of, in liaison with West Midlands Metro. 

During the Festival, I spent a lot of my time at specific gigs recording footage, supporting the artists and promoting the Festival with brochures & feedback forms. Additionally, mine and Olivia's (the other Experience Arts intern working for Big Bear at the time) role was largely to find new strategies of promoting the Festival on social media - we edited together TikToks, formatted announcement posts, etc., then attempted to post these in a schedule in order to try and optimise engagement. These posts would always have to be approved by the boss in advance of posting them. However, we would often be told that social media was lowest on the priority list and would have to frequently abandon this ongoing task in favour of other administrative tasks, like manually writing up the survey results from the audiences at the gigs.

## What did you find most valuable during this internship?
The communication skills required to work with the public, my co-workers, my boss and the artists performing have been varied and the frequency of which they were needed meant that I developed them quite quickly. Things like approaching members of the audiences at gigs and asking if they would mind filling in a feedback form was a requirement of the role, and so though it would usually be a task that would make me exceedingly uncomfortable, I had to get used to it very quickly in order to fulfil my role. Putting me out of my comfort zone in such a way was definitely very valuable to me.



## What parts of your internship did you find most challenging and how did you overcome these challenges?
The consistently most difficult task I found during the internship was the time demands being made of me by my boss and co-workers. Despite clarifying with my employer, before the internship, what my hours would be and how many I would be working in accordance with the Experience Arts agreement we then both signed, during the Festival I was consistently expected to work beyond these hours. The number agreed was 38 hours per week; by my own calculations, I was working around 59 hours in the last two weeks of my internship, as I was also working weekends. I had been informed of and agreed to working some evenings, but this was with the understanding that I would not have worked a full day beforehand (some of the worst cases were 12-hour days). The only day I stood up for myself and said I was clocking out after 8 hours, the next day I was then berated by a co-worker as to why I had not worked the evening before. 

Being overworked and shamed in this way cast a shadow over a working experience I had otherwise found a lot of motivation and fulfilment in. After having asserted my working rights prior to the internship I was very disappointed to have had these ignored. The only way I felt I could overcome this was continually overworking with the knowledge that I would be able to rest once the internship was over, however this would not have been a sustainable approach in a real job, so I still feel unsure as to how I should have handled this. Perhaps I could have overcome this more successfully by taking it up with my employer more assertively, but what with the atmosphere in the workplace, I did not feel comfortable doing so.

## Outline skills that you have gained during this internship.
I definitely gained some solid administrative experience and skills during this internship. While this is something I have done previously, it has often been volunteer work and been nothing terribly complicated, so the opportunity to engage with a much larger-scale project and assist with its organisation was invaluable.

The teamwork required was also very beneficial; attending company meetings, scribing for them, contributing data, and hearing the inner workings behind such a project was an experience I, to my surprise, quite enjoyed! I think that with a group of people that I felt more comfortable with I could have contributed more, but I believe I still handled these meetings adequately. 

I also gained some leadership skills while working with the group of volunteers during the festival

## Is there anything you wish you could have done differently, if so why?
There were times where I was uncertain what I was being asked to do - I wish I had had the confidence in the workplace to ask for clarification on what exactly the task was, as sometimes it left me in a state of anxiety as to whether I was doing the thing I was being asked to do. It would have allowed me to complete the task more successfully and devote more of my mental energy to the task itself. 

If I had had the opportunity to more fully focus on social media, I think it would have been the most valuable experience - as it was, I learned a lot about optimising engagement on social media posts, post regularity, video + audio editing, creating promotional content and using these posts to appeal to younger generations than the Festival usually has as its audience. Since this internship, I have taken to managing the social media profiles of both another musician and an ensemble that I'm in, both looking to promote themselves more to the general public, so I value that this internship gave me a taster of that and inspired me to get more experience in this area - it just would have been even more valuable had the company enough workforce to afford to allow us to put more time and work into social media promotion, as there was so much untapped potential there that I feel the company could capitalise on in order to expand their audience demographic.

## How will this experience help you with your future plans?
This experience has shown me that administrative and promotional roles are where I can thrive, and that perhaps the more hands-on tasks outside of the office are less suited to my interests. My career plans had previously been more focused on jobs that involve working independently, e.g. music journalism or academia, but this internship has definitely opened my mind up to the possibility of working more closely as part of a larger team. 

## What would you keep the same about the programme/project?
Much of the administrative work was very useful, as mentioned. I would keep much of the first two weeks of my internship the same - working on a variety of tasks, including communications and promotional material, was something that appealed to me massively, as I think doing the same task all the time would have led to me becoming unengaged with the project.

Taking part in the company meetings was also something I found hugely valuable -
