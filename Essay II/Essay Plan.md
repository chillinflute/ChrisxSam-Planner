## Q2. How, and with what results, did musicians associated with the Wiener Moderne challenge prevailing views of gender?
### INTRO
- As one of the most narrative-based forms of musical genre exemplifying modernist features, this essay will focus almost exclusively on opera

### POINT 1 - PORTRAYAL OF FEMALE CHARACTERS
- trend of female protagonists in Wiener Moderne opera
- *Elektra* + *Salome*, Strauss
	- difference in portrayal - Salome is inherently sexual and sexualised in the opera. Themes centre around seduction and manipulation via these means.
	- Elektra, despite the source material, is much less so - while there is still some element of femme fetale to her character, she is much less sexualised and the themes of the opera are much more focused on vengeance.
- *Lulu*
	- shocking deaths, etc
	- protagonist, everyone's deaths are as a reaction to Lulu

### POINT 2 - HOW THIS CONTRASTED TO THE SUCCESS OF FEMALE ARTISTS AT THE TIME
- modernist female artists - composers
	- Elizabeth Gyring - despite prolific compositional output (including a full-length opera and countless other works for a plethora of ensembles and soloists), her works are little-known and not well distributed or documented, even now [[@GuideElizabethGyring]] 
	- Alma Mahler-Werfel - some published works through husband Mahler, but for most of their marriage her compositional and artistic output was restricted. 
	- Johannes Müller-Hermann - large compositional and pedagogical contributions to Viennese musical culture in the early 20th century through her position as a tutor at the New Vienna Conservatory, yet these have been mostly forgotten, this generally attributed to the Nazi ideologies in Europe that followed [[@BBCRadioBreakfast]]
- modernist female artists - performers?

### POINT 3 - THE RECEPTION OF THESE OPERAS
- reception - went down well with the public
- critics were kinda horrified tbh

### CONCLUSION
- the idea of shock factor ( 'épater la bourgeoisie' - modernist desire to shock but please with his materials) influencing a lot of these challenging views - these musicians were not necessarily 'progressive' for their time so much as looking to produce the most shocking and unexpected events for their audiences, as was a trend in music and fine arts at the time
