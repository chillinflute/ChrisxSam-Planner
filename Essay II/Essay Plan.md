### INTRO

### POINT 1  
- trend of female protagonists in Wiener Moderne opera

### POINT 2
- *Lulu* + *Elektra* - femme fatale characters

### POINT 3

### CONCLUSION
- the idea of shock factor influencing a lot of these challenging views - these musicians were not necessarily 'progressive' for their time so much as looking to produce the most shocking and unexpected events for their audiences, as was a trend in music and fine arts at the time
