### POINT 2


### POINT 3
- reception

### CONCLUSION
- the idea of shock factor ( 'Ã©pater la bourgeoisie' - modernist desire to shock but please with his materials) influencing a lot of these challenging views - these musicians were not necessarily 'progressive' for their time so much as looking to produce the most shocking and unexpected events for their audiences, as was a trend in music and fine arts at the time
