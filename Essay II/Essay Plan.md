## Q2. How, and with what results, did musicians associated with the Wiener Moderne challenge prevailing views of gender?

### INTRO

### POINT 1  
- trend of female protagonists in Wiener Moderne opera
- *Elektra* + *Salome*, Strauss
	- difference in portrayal - Salome is inherently sexual and sexualised in the oepra
	- Elektra, despite the source material
- *Lulu*

### POINT 2
- modernist female artists - composers
	- Elizabeth Gyring

### POINT 3
- reception

### CONCLUSION
- the idea of shock factor ( 'Ã©pater la bourgeoisie' - modernist desire to shock but please with his materials) influencing a lot of these challenging views - these musicians were not necessarily 'progressive' for their time so much as looking to produce the most shocking and unexpected events for their audiences, as was a trend in music and fine arts at the time
