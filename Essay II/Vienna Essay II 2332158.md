## Q2. How, and with what results, did musicians associated with the Wiener Moderne challenge prevailing views of gender?
### INTRO
- As one of the most narrative-based forms of musical genre exemplifying modernist features, this essay will focus almost exclusively on opera

### POINT 1 - PORTRAYAL OF FEMALE CHARACTERS
- trend of female protagonists in Wiener Moderne opera
- *Elektra* + *Salome*, Strauss
	- difference in portrayal - Salome is inherently sexual and sexualised in the opera. Themes centre around seduction and manipulation via these means.
	- Elektra, despite the source material, is much less so - while there is still some element of femme fetale to her character, she is much less sexualised and the themes of the opera are much more focused on vengeance.
- *Lulu*
	- shocking deaths, etc
	- protagonist, everyone's deaths are as a reaction to Lulu

### POINT 2 - THE RECEPTION OF THESE OPERAS
- *Salome* 
	- went down well with the public
	- critics were kinda horrified tbh, because of the themes 
- *Elektra*
- *Lulu*

### POINT 3 - HOW THIS CONTRASTED TO THE SUCCESS OF FEMALE ARTISTS AT THE TIME

Despite the prolific compositional output of Elizabeth Gyring (including a full-length opera and countless other works for a plethora of ensembles and soloists), her works are currently little-known and not well distributed or documented, even now [[@GuideElizabethGyring|(Washington State University Libraries, 2022)]]. There is little to no record that her works were performed at the time of writing and her name has been lost to time.

My next example is the composer Alma Mahler-Werfel. She was able to publish some works with the support of her husband, Gustav Mahler, towards the end of their marriage, but for much of their relationship her compositional and artistic output was restricted [[@HilmesOliver2015Mm_t|(Hilmes, 2015)]]. An interesting case, due to her relationship with Mahler, which seems to be her only feature of interest among many music scholars despite her own compositional output, yet a harsh judgement seems to have been cast upon her within the academic community. Many of the articles and materials published since Alma's death regard her as unfaithful, vain, academically unreliable - these conclusions all drawn from her diaries and other people's first-hand accounts of her. Most frustratingly, many of the sources I consulted in the course of this research feel interwoven with misogyny, exemplified particularly in Volume 2 of Le Grange's biography of Mahler [[@LaGrangeHenry-Louisde1995GM_H|(1995)]]. 

Ironically, the way Alma has been characterised since her time aligns with some elements of the femme fatale persona assigned to these early modernist opera protagonists; the sense of cold calculation, potency and lacking empathy in the way she is portrayed, as well as method by which she is constantly described as an accomplished seductress , strangely ties in with these portrayals, for example the character of Salome. 
Her works have seen a small revival since her time in Vienna among her increased popularity in the United States, where she moved before World War II. 

Johannes Müller-Hermann - large compositional and pedagogical contributions to Viennese musical culture in the early 20th century through her position as a tutor at the New Vienna Conservatory, yet these have been mostly forgotten, this generally attributed to the Nazi ideologies in Europe that followed [[@BBCRadioBreakfast]]. Despite the fact her work, 'Sonata for Cello and Pianoforte', was showcased in the 1920s, the only reception among records was scathingly critical of her work, dismissing it purely because of her sex [[@10.2307_914127|(Bechert, 1923)]].
- modernist female artists - performers?

### CONCLUSION
- the idea of shock factor ( 'épater la bourgeoisie' - modernist desire to shock but please with his materials) influencing a lot of these challenging views - these musicians were not necessarily 'progressive' for their time so much as looking to produce the most shocking and unexpected events for their audiences, as was a trend in music and fine arts at the time
