## Q2. How, and with what results, did musicians associated with the Wiener Moderne challenge prevailing views of gender?
### INTRO
In order to assess the way in which musicians challenged views relating to gender in the Wiener Moderne, the following must be established: what the "prevailing views of gender" were, at this time; the manner in which both male and female characters were portrayed; how this was received by audiences, i.e. both the critical reception and the reaction of the general public. I will also be using examples of female musicians in Vienna at the time in order to compare and contrast the ways in which their lives were lead against the characters in the operas that will be discussed, as well as the light in which these women are presented by historians since.

As one of the most narrative-based musical genres exemplifying modernist features, when considering musical examples this essay will focus almost exclusively on opera. Programmatic music, and other forms that have potential to portray gendered characters, tend to be more abstract; the composer's intentions are more obscure, and the success with which these are portrayed, as well as the audience's internalisation of these ideas, become more difficult to define with certainty.

Ideas on gender in Vienna during the *fin-de-siècle* were certainly complex; in the political context of both a right-wing mayor at the time, Karl Lüger, and the aftermath of Otto Weininger's famous treatise *Geschlecht und Charakter* [[@chandlerRitualSacrificeWomen2010|(Chandler 2010)]], women were definitely still not thought of as capable of having careers in the same way as of men. It was in fact these frequent attacks on women's rights that led to the formation of activist groups, as it seemed that the state of these rights were regressing as opposed to progressing. The battle for and against equality was fierce on both sides - which made for a very charged political climate in which to present 'controversial' artwork.
A direct comparison of the presentation of women in opera to some of the female artists that are known of from the time will be made in the course of this essay; contrasting these new ideas about gender roles and sex-related predisposition with the reality of the lives of women, in particular, composers, is essential to quantifying the differences.

### POINT 1 - PORTRAYAL OF FEMALE CHARACTERS & OPERA RECEPTION
Most notably, there was a trend of female protagonists in Wiener Moderne opera, beginning in the early twentieth century; the first example to discuss being *Salome*, by Richard Strauss [[@lachmannSalome|(1905)]]. The movement of modernism in music, particularly opera, was only just coming into its own, and so the themes Strauss was portraying through his music were initially very controversial - *Salome* was, in its first instance, rejected by the Viennese Court Opera [[@rossRestNoiseListening2008|(Ross 2008)]]; the Austrian premiere of the opera instead relegated to Graz. This was for good reason: *Salome* is now regarded as a massive musical turning point in Western classical history, due to its extremes of bitonality, dissonant harmony, disjunct melody-writing and, most critically, its subject matter. Discussing biblical figures, thrusting shocking sins such as violent suicide, incest, and necrophilia upon them, was naturally something the State Opera considered blasphemous, as they were so out-of-line with the views held by the upper class, in particular those relating to women. Female characters had never held such power in opera until this moment, rendering many of their male cast powerless.

One can see this in *Salome* through the eponymous character of Salome herself. As the protagonist, the world of the opera is naturally built and structured around her, in some cases to a ridiculous point - one example of this being the guard who desires her at the beginning of the play, but dramatically kills himself at the sight of Salome expressing romantic feelings for Jochanaan. Suicide is not a new theme to opera [[@stackOPERASUBCULTURESUICIDE2002|(Stack 2002)]], but the treatment of it in *Salome* strays outrageously from the norm. The guard's death is sudden, unexpected and explicit, illustrating the concept of 'épater la bourgeoisie' that became relatively common among modernists [(Attfield 2022)]. This is not even to mention that this is a male character, acting so strongly in response to a female character, a new phenomenon for opera.
The character archetype of Salome could now be defined as *'femme fatale'*;

Astonishingly, *Salome* was a roaring success with its first audiences [[@rossRestNoiseListening2008|(Ross 2008)]]. Despite all its controversialism and what an immense change it was from the other operas performed at the time, *Salome*'s premiere in Germany led to an influx of other performances all over Europe. However, due to how far it strayed from the popular ideas of Western Classical tradition at the time, this being late Romanticism, the critical reception of the opera was furiously disapproving [citation needed].


*Elektra* [citation needed] was written several years after *Salome*, but is another example of Strauss's modernists operas portraying women in an unusual light. Despite the source material of *Elektra* implying a sexual relationship between Elektra and her father [[@aeschylusOresteia|(Aeschylus ca. 500 BCE)]], interestingly, Strauss writes the opera in exclusion of this detail. Perhaps the logic was that he wished not to create a character so rich in power due to her sexuality and seductive power in the same way he had in Salome, so as not to exhibit all of the same themes, despite the remaining commonalities between the characters. Perhaps it was simply that the particular retelling he and Hofmannsthal chose to base the libretto on also excluded this [research needed to establish which retelling this was based on]. Fundamentally though, this leads to some core differences between the characters of Salome and Elektra: though both operas are named for their (anti)-heroines and present them as powerful figures, both characters also die at the end of the opera as retribution for their actions; while Elektra is potrayed as powerful, this is not for her ability to weaponise her sexuality, as in the case of Salome, but her sheer will for vengeance.

- *Lulu*
	- shocking deaths, etc
	- protagonist, everyone's deaths are as a reaction to Lulu



### POINT 2 - THE RECEPTION OF THESE OPERAS

- *Elektra*
	- divided reception between traditionalists and modernists [[@GilliamBryan1991RSE_]]
- *Lulu*

### POINT 3 - HOW THIS CONTRASTED TO THE SUCCESS OF FEMALE ARTISTS AT THE TIME

It is important to examine the success of women from this era - 

Despite the prolific compositional output of Elizabeth Gyring (including a full-length opera and countless other works for a plethora of ensembles and soloists), her works are currently little-known and not well-distributed or -documented, even now [[@GuideElizabethGyring|(Washington State University Libraries 2022)]]. There is little to no record that her works were performed at the time of writing and her name has been lost to time, showing the utter lack of recognition attributed to female modernist composers at the time of *Salome*, *Elektra* and *Lulu*, despite the subject matter putting women at the forefront.

Johannes Müller-Hermann was another modernist composer who made large compositional and pedagogical contributions to Viennese musical culture in the early 20th century through her position as a tutor at the New Vienna Conservatory. Yet, these have been mostly forgotten, this generally attributed to the Nazi ideologies in Europe that followed [[@BBCRadioBreakfast|(BBC n.d.)]]. Despite the fact her work, 'Sonata for Cello and Pianoforte', was showcased in the 1920s, the only reception on record was scathingly critical of her work, dismissing it purely because of her sex [[@10.2307_914127|(Bechert 1923)]]. 

A further example is the composer Alma Mahler-Werfel. She was able to publish some works with the support of her husband, Gustav Mahler, towards the end of their marriage, but for much of their relationship her compositional and artistic output was restricted [[@HilmesOliver2015Mm_t|(Hilmes 2015)]]. Mahler-Werfel was an interesting case due to her complex relationship with Mahler, which seems to be her only notable feature to many scholars despite her own compositional output; yet, a harsh judgement seems to have been cast upon her within the academic community. Many of the articles and materials published since Mahler-Werfel's death regard her as unfaithful, vain, and accuse her of providing unreliable historical accounts [[@LaGrangeHenry-Louisde1995GM_H|(Le Grange 1995)]] — these conclusions all drawn from her diaries, letters, and other people's first-hand accounts of her.
Curiously, the way Mahler-Werfel has been characterised by scholars and the media since her death aligns with some elements of the femme fatale persona assigned to these early modernist opera protagonists; the sense of cold calculation, potency, and slyness in the way she is portrayed, as well as the method by which she is constantly described as an accomplished seductress [[@downingREVIEWBooksShe2015|(Downing 2015)]], ties in with these portrayals, for example the character of Salome. It is frustrating, if not surprising, that many of the sources consulted in the course of this research are interwoven with misogyny, exemplified particularly in Volume 2 of Le Grange's biography of Gustav Mahler [[@LaGrangeHenry-Louisde1995GM_H|(1995)]] and Beaumont's *Gustav Mahler: Letters to His Wife* [[@mahler2004gustav|(2004)]], but some recognition of the manipulation of her image in the academic community seems to be coming about in recent years [[@10.1525_jams.2022.75.1.39|(Newman 2022)]]. In her lifetime, Mahler-Werfel herself certainly challenged prevailing views of gender in Vienna by endeavouring for have a compositional career, and was very prominent in the cultural scene of Vienna due to family ties and artist friends [[@HilmesOliver2015Mm_t|(Hilmes 2015)]], but ultimately her own accounts of her life were discredited and restored into a story that would put her first husband, Mahler, in a more honourable light. Her works have seen a small revival since her time in Vienna among her increased popularity in the United States, where she moved before World War II, but still remain distant from the repute of Mahler's. 

### CONCLUSION

Considering the phenomenal audience response to *Salome* for example, it is fair to say that modernists such as Strauss were successful with their challenging views of gender

Another factor to consider is how the idea of shock factor played into modernist composers' creative decision-making. As previously referred to under the phrase 'épater la bourgeoisie', this was a fairly common practice during the modernist movement. Based on this, one can ascertain that these musicians were not necessarily 'progressive' for their time or even in holding of these beliefs, so much as looking to produce the most shocking and unexpected events for their audiences.
