## Q2. How, and with what results, did musicians associated with the Wiener Moderne challenge prevailing views of gender?
### INTRO
- As one of the most narrative-based forms of musical genre exemplifying modernist features, this essay will focus almost exclusively on opera

### POINT 1 - PORTRAYAL OF FEMALE CHARACTERS
- trend of female protagonists in Wiener Moderne opera
- *Elektra* + *Salome*, Strauss
	- difference in portrayal - Salome is inherently sexual and sexualised in the opera. Themes centre around seduction and manipulation via these means.
	- Elektra, despite the source material, is much less so - while there is still some element of femme fetale to her character, she is much less sexualised and the themes of the opera are much more related to vengeance.
- *Lulu*
	- shocking deaths, etc
	- protagonist, everyone's deaths are as a reaction to Lulu

### POINT 2 - THE RECEPTION OF THESE OPERAS
- *Salome* 
	- went down well with the public
	- critics were kinda horrified tbh, because of the themes 
- *Elektra*
- *Lulu*

### POINT 3 - HOW THIS CONTRASTED TO THE SUCCESS OF FEMALE ARTISTS AT THE TIME

Despite the prolific compositional output of Elizabeth Gyring (including a full-length opera and countless other works for a plethora of ensembles and soloists), her works are currently little-known and not well-distributed or -documented, even now [[@GuideElizabethGyring|(Washington State University Libraries, 2022)]]. There is little to no record that her works were performed at the time of writing and her name has been lost to time, showing the utter lack of recognition attributed to female modernist composers at the time of *Salome*, *Elektra* and *Lulu*, despite the subject matter putting women at the forefront.

A further example is the composer Alma Mahler-Werfel. She was able to publish some works with the support of her husband, Gustav Mahler, towards the end of their marriage, but for much of their relationship her compositional and artistic output was restricted [[@HilmesOliver2015Mm_t|(Hilmes, 2015)]]. Mahler-Werfel was an interesting case due to her relationship with Mahler, which seems to be her only notable feature to many scholars despite her own compositional output; yet a harsh judgement seems to have been cast upon her within the academic community. Many of the articles and materials published since Mahler-Werfel's death regard her as unfaithful, vain, and accuse her of providing unreliable historical accounts [[@LaGrangeHenry-Louisde1995GM_H|(Le Grange, 1995)]] — these conclusions all drawn from her diaries, letters, and other people's first-hand accounts of her.
Curiously, the way Mahler-Werfel has been characterised since her death aligns with some elements of the femme fatale persona assigned to these early modernist opera protagonists; the sense of cold calculation, potency, and slyness in the way she is portrayed, as well as the method by which she is constantly described as an accomplished seductress [citation needed], ties in with these portrayals, for example the character of Salome. Frustratingly, if not many of the sources consulted in the course of this research are interwoven with misogyny, exemplified particularly in Volume 2 of Le Grange's biography of Gustav Mahler [[@LaGrangeHenry-Louisde1995GM_H|(1995)]] and Beaumont's *Gustav Mahler: Letters to His Wife* [[@mahler2004gustav|(2004)]], but some recognition of the manipulation of her image in the academic community seems to be coming about in recent years [[@10.1525_jams.2022.75.1.39|(Newman, 2022)]]. In her lifetime, Mahler-Werfel herself certainly challenged prevailing views of gender in Vienna by attempting to have a musician's career, and was very prominent in the cultural scene of Vienna due to family ties and artist friends [[@HilmesOliver2015Mm_t|(Hilmes, 2015)]], but ultimately her own accounts of her life were discredit and restored to a story that would put Mahler in a more honourable light.
Her works have seen a small revival since her time in Vienna among her increased popularity in the United States, where she moved before World War II, but still remain distant from the repute of her first husband's.

Johannes Müller-Hermann - large compositional and pedagogical contributions to Viennese musical culture in the early 20th century through her position as a tutor at the New Vienna Conservatory, yet these have been mostly forgotten, this generally attributed to the Nazi ideologies in Europe that followed [[@BBCRadioBreakfast]]. Despite the fact her work, 'Sonata for Cello and Pianoforte', was showcased in the 1920s, the only reception among records was scathingly critical of her work, dismissing it purely because of her sex [[@10.2307_914127|(Bechert, 1923)]].

### CONCLUSION
- the idea of shock factor ( 'épater la bourgeoisie' - modernist desire to shock but please with his materials) influencing a lot of these challenging views - these musicians were not necessarily 'progressive' for their time so much as looking to produce the most shocking and unexpected events for their audiences, as was a trend in music and fine arts at the time
