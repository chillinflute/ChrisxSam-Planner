## Description of project
Due to the 9am start time on the first day of the conference, I plan to travel to Edinburgh the day before. From the start of the conference, I will be able to take notes, ask questions and otherwise engage with the talks being given for the full three days, with mine and Chris's talk on the final day. There will also be evening activities to take part in with the other attendees, allowing for network and potential future collaboration with academic specialists.
