# Questions for Application Form

## In 250 words or less, describe your manuscript’s intended purpose. You may use this space to offer a general description of your project or an outline of your argument as it may appear in your abstract or introduction.

Chris Sawyer's *Transport Tycoon*[^1] (1994) was a critical success for the business management genre of games, and perhaps is only relegated to comparative obscurity due to the meteoric rise of his *Rollercoaster Tycoon* which was to follow (1999). It single-handedly created a new subgenre of management game, the transport management sim, which has maintained a passionate community of players and developers, with new releases like *Transport Fever 2* (2019) and *OpenTTD* (2004), an ongoing fan-maintained/modified open-source distibution of Sawyer's original game, continuing to pioneer the concept. 

With such a tight-knit community emerging around these games, a similarly close group of composers have formed to contribute to the soundtracks. John Broomhall and Allistair Brimble contributed the lion's share to *TT* and *Locomotion* (2004), with Brimble staying on

## In 250 words or less, describe how your field of study stands to benefit from your research.

Ludomusicology is a burgeoning field that often tries to position itself in relation to both traditional musical multimedia works, and also in its role within digital audiovisual works. Work by Tim Summers, Stephanie Lind, and Mark Sweeney have explored encounters between games and other musical forms, and musical identities with their themes in relation to how those themes are handled in other audiovisual media. 

Now games are reaching an age where multiple generations of game designers and composers have had the chance to establish their creative identity, they raise the question of how those identities have influenced each other, and what inspiration composers have taken from their forebears in the creation of their soundtracks. 

This research poses that, since composers often stay within similar game genres across their creative output, these factors lay the foundation for musical identities to crystallise around the ludic genres that a succession of composers work within. It will argue that this is especially true within niche genres — where tight-knit creative communities form — and indie development environments — where often only a handful of composers will have influence, often (e.g. Toby Fox, Eric Barone) the game designers/developers themselves.

In this way, the research aims to examine patterns that are distinct to the field of videogame music, whilst drawing upon observations from older multimedia art traditions to understand how sonic identities establish themselves, and how those identities inform the evolution of a genre's soundworlds.
